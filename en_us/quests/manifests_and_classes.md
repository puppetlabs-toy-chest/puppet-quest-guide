# Manifests and classes

## Quest objectives

- Understand how Puppet code is organized into *classes*, contained within *manifest* files.
- Learn how the module structure keeps your Puppet code organized in a way the Puppet master understands.
- Create a new Puppet module to manage the `cowsay` and `fortune` packages. 

## Getting started

So far you've learned about the basics of Puppet's *resource abstraction
layer*, the relationship between the Puppet agent and master, and the
communication between the agent and master involved in a Puppet agent run.
Other than modifying a few basic resources, however, you haven't yet written
much Puppet code.

The patterns and workflows used to organize, maintain, and deploy Puppet code
are just as important as the code itself. Though some of the examples we give
here may seem overly complex given the simplicity of what we're managing,
starting with good design will keep everything working smoothly as you start
managing a more complex Puppet infrastructure.

In this quest, you'll learn how Puppet code is organized into *manifests*,
*classes*, and *modules*, and how to apply classes to nodes with the
`site.pp` manifest. These basics will give you a solid foundation when
you begin to work with more complex code management methods for your Puppet
code.

When you're ready to get started, enter the following command:

    quest begin manifests_and_classes

### Manifests

> Imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.

> -James Cameron

At its simplest, a Puppet *manifest* is Puppet code saved to a file with the
`.pp` extension. This code is written in the Puppet *domain specific
language* (DSL). You already saw some examples of this DSL as you learned
about resources. The Puppet DSL includes resource declarations, along with a set
of other language features, that let you control which resources are applied on
a system and what values are set for those resources' parameters.

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 1:</p></div>

Go ahead and ssh to the node we've created for this quest. Remember, the
password for this and all the agent systems you'll use in this Quest Guide is
`puppet`.

    ssh learning@cowsay.puppet.vm

Create a throw-away manifest in our `/tmp/` directory to see how this works. 

    vim /tmp/hello.pp

Use the same notify resource declaration you included in your `site.pp` in the
previous quest:

```puppet
notify { 'Hello Puppet!': }
```

(Remember, use `ESC` then `:wq` to save and exit.)

Rather than classifying this node on the master and triggering a Puppet agent
run, apply this manifest directly with the `puppet apply` tool. You can use the
`puppet apply` tool to test Puppet code in a manifest just like you can use the 
`puppet resource` tool to explore and modify resources directly.

    sudo puppet apply /tmp/hello.pp 

Now you know how to save Puppet code to a file, but how do you bridge the gap
between this saved Puppet code and the `site.pp` manifest where you define
node classification? The first step is to organize your Puppet code into
*classes* and *modules*.

### Classes and modules

A *class* is named block of Puppet code. *Defining* a class
combines a group of resources into single reusable and configurable unit. Once
*defined*, a class can then be *declared* to tell Puppet to apply the
resources it contains.

A class should bring together a set of resources that manage one logical
component of a system. For example, a class written to manage a MS SQL Server
might include resources to manage the package, configuration files, and service
for the MS SQL Server instance. Because each of these components relies on the
others, it makes sense to manage them together. You're not likely to want a server with
MS SQL configuration files without the MS SQL application package itself.

A *module* is a directory structure that lets Puppet keep track of where to
find the manifests that contain your classes. A module also contains other data
a class might rely on, such as the templates for configuration files. When you
apply a class to a node, the Puppet master checks in a list of directories
called a *modulepath* for a module directory matching the class name. The master then
looks in that module's `manifests` subdirectory to find the manifest containing
the class definition. It reads the Puppet code contained in that class
definition and uses it to compile a catalog defining a desired state for the
node.

All this will be much easier to understand with an example in front of you.
Let's dive in and write a simple module.

## Write a cowsay module

By way of example, we'll write a module to manage a small program called
cowsay. Cowsay lets you print a message inside a speech bubble coming from the
mouth of an ASCII cow.

Before you create a new manifest, you need to know where to keep it. For Puppet
to find your code, you need to place it in a module directory in Puppet's
*modulepath*.

If you're still connected to `cowsay.puppet.vm` disconnect to return to your
master system.

    exit

To see what your configured modulepath is, run the following command:

    puppet config print modulepath

The output is a list of directories separated by the colon (`:`) character.

```
/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/code/modules:/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules
```

For now, we'll work in the first directory listed in the modulepath. This
directory includes modules specific to the production environment. (The second directory
contains modules used across all environments, and the third is modules that PE
uses to configure itself).

Because we're focusing on the structure of your module and class, we'll be
writing our code directly to the modulepath on the master. In a real production
environment, however, you would likely want to keep your Puppet code in a
version control repository such as Git and use Puppet's code manager tool to
deploy it to your master. Because we don't have any critical infrastructure
relying on the VM, we can safely skip this step and dive right into the code.

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 2:</p></div>

Use `cd` to navigate to the `modules` directory.

    cd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules

Create a directory structure for a new module called `cowsay`. (The `-p`
flag allows you to create the `cowsay` parent directory and `manifests`
subdirectory at once.)

    mkdir -p cowsay/manifests

With this directory structure in place, it's time to create the manifest where
we'll write the `cowsay` class.

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 3:</p></div>

Use vim to create an `init.pp` manifest in your module's `manifests` directory.

    vim cowsay/manifests/init.pp

If this manifest is going to contain the `cowsay` class, you might be wondering
why we're calling it `init.pp` instead of `cowsay.pp`. Most modules contain a
main class like this whose name corresponds with the name of the module itself.
This main class is always kept in a manifest with the special name `init.pp`.

Enter the following class definition, then save and exit (`:wq`):

[//]: # (code/040_manifests_and_classes/modules/cowsay/manifests/init.pp)

```puppet
class cowsay {
  package { 'cowsay':
    ensure   => present,
    provider => 'gem',
  }
}
```

(Notice that we've specified `gem` as the provider for this package. Apparently
`cowsay` isn't important enough to live in any of the default yum package
repositories, so we're telling Puppet to use the `gem` provider to install a
version of the package written in Ruby and published on RubyGems.)

It's always good practice to validate your code before you try to apply it. Use
the `puppet parser` tool to check the syntax of your new manifest.

    puppet parser validate cowsay/manifests/init.pp
	
The parser will return nothing if there are no errors. If it does detect a
syntax error, open the file again and fix the problem before continuing. Be
aware that this validation can only catch simple syntax errors and won't let
you know about other possible errors in your manifests.

Now that the `cowsay` class is defined in your module's `init.pp` manifest,
your Puppet master knows exactly where to find the appropriate Puppet code when
you apply the `cowsay` class to a node.

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 4:</p></div>

In the setup for this quest, the quest tool prepared a `cowsay.puppet.vm`
node. Let's apply the `cowsay` class to this node. First, open your `site.pp`
manifest.

    vim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp

At the end of the `site.pp` manifest, insert the following code:

[//]: # (code/040_manifests_and_classes/manifests/site.pp)

```puppet
node 'cowsay.puppet.vm' {
  include cowsay
}
```

Save and exit.

This `include cowsay` line tells the Puppet master to parse the contents of the
`cowsay` class when it compiles a catalog for the `cowsay.puppet.vm` node.

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 5:</p></div>

Now that you've added the `cowsay` class to your classification for the
`cowsay.puppet.vm` node, let's connect to that node and trigger a Puppet agent
run to see the changes applied.

    ssh learning@cowsay.puppet.vm

Before applying any changes to your system, it's always a good idea to use the
`--noop` flag to do a practice run of the Puppet agent. This will compile the
catalog and notify you of the changes that Puppet would have made without
actually applying any of those changes to your system. It's a good way to catch
issues the `puppet parser validate` command can't detect, and gives you a
chance to validate that Puppet will be making the changes you expect.

    sudo puppet agent -t --noop

You should see an output like the following:

    Notice: Compiled catalog for cowsay.puppet.vm in environment production in
    0.62 seconds
    Notice: /Stage[main]/Cowsay/Package[cowsay]/ensure: current_value
    absent, should be present (noop)
    Notice: Class[Cowsay]: Would have triggered 'refresh' from 1
    events
    Notice: Stage[main]: Would have triggered 'refresh' from 1 events
    Notice: Finished catalog run in 1.08 seconds

If your dry run looks good, go ahead and run the Puppet agent again without the
`--noop` flag.

    sudo puppet agent -t

Now you can try out your newly installed cowsay command:

    cowsay Puppet is awesome!

Your bovine friend clearly knows what's up.

     ____________________
    < Puppet is awesome! >
     --------------------
            \   ^__^
             \  (oo)\_______
                (__)\       )\/\
                    ||----w |
                    ||     ||

### Composed classes and class scope

A module often includes multiple components that work together to serve a
single function. Cowsay alone is great, but many users don't have the time to
write out a custom high-quality message on each execution of the command. For
this reason, cowsay is often used in conjunction with the `fortune` command,
which provides you and your cow with a database of sayings and wisdom to draw
on.

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 6:</p></div>

Disconnect from the `cowsay.puppet.vm` node to return to your master.

    exit

Create a new manifest for your `fortune` class definition.

    vim cowsay/manifests/fortune.pp

Write your class definition here:

[//]: # (code/040_manifests_and_classes/modules/cowsay/manifests/fortune.pp)

```puppet
class cowsay::fortune {
  package { 'fortune-mod':
    ensure => present,
  }
}
```

Note that unlike the main `init.pp` manifest, the filename of the manifest
shows us the name of the class it defines. In fact, because this class is
contained in the `cowsay` module, its full name is `cowsay::fortune`.  The two
colons that connect `cowsay` and `fortune` are pronounced "scope scope" and
indicate that this `fortune` class is contained in the cowsay module scope.
Notice how the fully scoped name of the class tells Puppet exactly where to
find it in your module path: the `fortune.pp` manifest in the `cowsay` module's
`manifests` directory. This naming pattern also helps avoid conflicts among
similarly named classes provided by different modules.

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 7:</p></div>

Again, validate your new manifest's syntax with the `puppet parser validate`
command.

    puppet parser validate cowsay/manifests/fortune.pp

We could use another include statement in the `site.pp` manifest to classify
`cowsay.puppet.vm` with this `cowsay::fortune` class. In general, however, it's
best to keep your classification as simple as possible.

In this case, use a class declaration to pull the `cowsay::fortune` class
into our main `cowsay` class.

    vim cowsay/manifests/init.pp

Add an include statement for your `cowsay::fortune` class to the cowsay class.

[//]: # (code/040_manifests_and_classes/modules/cowsay/manifests/init.pp)

```puppet
class cowsay {
  package { 'cowsay':
    ensure   => present,
    provider => 'gem',
  }
  include cowsay::fortune
}
```

Use the `puppet parser validate` command to check your syntax.

    puppet parser validate cowsay/manifests/init.pp

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 8:</p></div>

Return to your `cowsay.puppet.vm` node so we can test out these changes.

    ssh learning@cowsay.puppet.vm

Trigger a Puppet agent run with the `--noop` flag to check what changes Puppet
will make.

    sudo puppet agent -t --noop

Notice that because the cowsay package is already installed, Puppet
won't make any changes to this package. Now that you've included the
`cowsay::fortune` package, Puppet knows that it needs to install the
`fortune-mod` package to bring your node into the desired state you defined for
it.

Trigger another Puppet run without the `--noop` flag to make these changes.

    sudo puppet agent -t

Now that you have both packages installed, you can use them together. Try
piping the output of the `fortune` command to `cowsay`.

    fortune | cowsay

Now that you've seen the results of your Puppet run, disconnect to return to
your Puppet master.

    exit
	
## Review

We began this quest with a discussion of the importance of keeping your Puppet
code well organized. This structure of *classes*, *manifests*, and *modules*
keeps your code organized in logical, reusable units. Keeping your modules within
Puppet's *modulepath* allows the Puppet master to find the classes contained
within them.

Using what you learned, you created a new module to manage the `cowsay`
package, then extended this module by creating a new class to manage the
`fortune-mod` package.

As you move ahead in this guide, you will continue to use this organizational
scheme to structure the Puppet code you write.
