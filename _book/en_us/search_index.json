Guide v2.5.1\nQuest Guide for the Puppet Learning VM\nAbout the Learning VM and this Quest Guide\nThe Learning VM (Virtual Machine) is a self-contained learning environment\nthat includes everything a new user needs to get started learning Puppet.\nBecause learning Puppet requires making changes to a system&#39;s configuration,\nit&#39;s not wise to play with it directly on your own laptop or desktop. Not\neveryone who wants to learn Puppet, however, has easy access to a system\nwhere he or she can experiment freely. And even those who do will benefit\nfrom an environment with Puppet Enterprise pre-installed and a set of tools\nto help guide you through the basics of configuration management with Puppet.\nThis guide is the companion to the Learning VM. The content of the guide is\npaired with a quest command line tool on the VM that will provide live\nfeedback as you progress through the list of tasks associated with each\nquest in this guide. By breaking each concept into a series of incremental\nand validated steps, we can ensure that you stay on track as you progress\nthrough the guide.\nWho should use the Learning VM?\nThis guide should be useful for any reader with an interest in configuration\nmanagement, system administration, or related tasks. We have done our best to\navoid any assumptions about a reader&#39;s familiarity with a specific operating\nsystem. While users familiar with a Linux command-line interface will already be\nfamiliar with most of the commands used in this guide, those more accustomed\nto a graphical user interface will find all necessary commands provided.\nThe Learning VM comes with Puppet Enterprise installed, and some of the\ncontent is specific to Puppet Enterprise. Users interested in the open source\nversion of Puppet will nonetheless benefit from the majority of the content.\nCertain features, such as the graphical web console and high availability,\nare exclusive to Puppet Enterprise. Content related to the Puppet\nmaster-agent architecture, Puppet code, and module structure will be generally\napplicable to the open source version of Puppet.\n"},"SETUP.html":{"url":"SETUP.html","title":"Setup","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nSet up the Learning VM\nGet the VM\nIf you haven&#39;t already, download the Learning VM.\nVirtualization setup\nGet an up-to-date version of your preferred virtualization software.\nVirtualBox is free and available\nfor Linux, Mac, and Windows systems. VMware has several desktop virtualization\napplications, including VMware\nFusion for Mac and VMware\nWorkstation for Windows.\nThe Learning VM OVA file must be imported rather than opened directly.\nLaunch your virtualization software and find an Import or Import\nAppliance option in the File menu. If you cannot locate an Import\noption, refer to your virtualization software&#39;s documentation.\nThe Learning VM has been preset with 4GB of memory allocation for the virtual\nmachine. This should be sufficient for starting it and Puppet Enterprise\nrunning inside it. If available, you can increase the virtual machine memory\nallocation as needed.\nNetworking configuration\nAll the packages and modules needed to complete the Quest Guide are hosted\nlocally on the VM itself, but you will need to set up networking to access the\nVM from your host system.\nYour virtualization software provides several options for network configuration.\nIf you are using VirtualBox on a network without a proxy or restrictive\nfirewall rules, you may find it simpler to use the bridged adapter described\nin the online configuration section below.\nIf you are on a network that may have a proxy or restrictive\nfirewall rules (ask your network administrator if you&#39;re not sure), we strongly\nsuggest running the VM with an offline host-only network. This offline\nconfiguration requires more complex initial setup with VirtualBox software, but\nwill help you avoid troubleshooting networking issues between your Puppet\nmaster and agent systems.\nOnline\nIf you would like to run the Learning VM with internet access, set the\nNetwork Adapter to Bridged. Use an Autodetect setting if available, or\naccept the default Network Adapter name. (If you started the VM before making\nthese changes, you may need to restart the VM before the settings will be\napplied correctly.)\nNote that the Puppet module tool, yum, and RubyGems are configured to use local\nrepositories, so you will not be able to access remote content without manually\nchanging the settings for these tools. While we encourage exploration, we are\nnot currently able to support issues beyond the scope of the Quest Guide.\nOffline\nFor VirtualBox:\nTo use host-only networking on VirtualBox, you will need to create and\nconfigure a new network from the VirtualBox preferences panel. Note that this\nmay be called settings on some systems. Be sure that you&#39;re looking at the\npreferences for VirtualBox itself, not the settings configurations for a\nspecific VM.\nOpen the VirtualBox preferences panel and select the network section.\nSelect Host-only Networks. Create a new network, and click the screwdriver\nicon to the side of the dialog to edit the network configuration. In the\nAdapter section, enter the following settings:  \nIPv4 Address: 192.168.56.1IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0  \nIn the DHCP Server section, enter the following settings:\nCheck the Enable Server boxServer Address: 192.168.56.1Server Mask: 255.255.255.0Lower Address Bound: 192.168.56.110Upper Address Bound: 192.168.56.200  \nClick OK to accept the adapter configuration changes, and again to exit the\npreferences dialog. Open the settings section for the Learning VM from the\nVirtualBox Manager window. Go to the Network section, select Host-only\nAdapter from the drop-down menu, and select the name of the host-only adapter\nyou created from the Name: drop-down.

The company has over\n1000 enterprise customers, including 75 of the Fortune 100. Puppet has a robust\nuser community that has built many thousands of contributed modules comprising\nover 7.5M lines of code. Additionally, tens of thousands of organizations use\nopen-source Puppet to manage their server infrastructure.\nOver time, the company has expanded its offerings to the following portfolio\nof enterprise products:\n\nPuppet Bolt: Perform ad hoc system configuration tasks on your infrastructure\nPuppet Enterprise: Build model-driven configuration for your IT infrastructure\nPuppet Pipelines: Simplify your application delivery and deployment process\nPuppet Insights: Visually measure and optimize your DevOps investment\n\nPuppet Bolt and Puppet Enterprise will be the focus of the Learning VM. We\ninvite you to visit https://puppet.com/products\nfor additional information of the entire suite of Puppet products.\nPuppet Bolt\nBolt is an open-source remote task runner that automates the manual work that you do\nto maintain your infrastructure. Use Bolt to automate tasks that you need to\nperform on your infrastructure on an ad hoc basis, such as troubleshooting,\ndeploying an applications, stopping and starting services, and upgrading a\ndatabase schema. Bolt connects directly to remote nodes with SSH or WinRM, so\nyou are not required to install any agent software.\nIn the Learning VM, Bolt will be installed and used to install the Puppet agent\non a target node much like you would do as you begin to deploy Puppet on your\ninfrastructure. Think of using Bolt as the first step of your infrastructure\nautomation journey. It can easily leverage existing scripts that you have\nwritten in any language and allow you to execute them on remote nodes in\nparallel.\nOver time, you can then convert configuration tasks to Puppet code\nfor long-term management of your infrastructure. Even in that scenario, Bolt\nis a powerful tool for performing tasks that are not as easily done with the\nPuppet agent, such as stopping a database server, performing a schema upgrade,\nand restarting the server.\nReview\nIn this quest, we introduced you to Puppet the company and its portfolio of\nproducts. In the Learning VM, we will focus on the use of Puppet Bolt and\nPuppet Enterprise to show how straightforward it is to begin your\ninfrastructure automation journey.\n"},"quests/hello_bolt.html":{"url":"quests/hello_bolt.html","title":"Hello Bolt","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nHello Bolt\nQuest objectives\n\nInstall Puppet Bolt\nVerify the Puppet Bolt installation\nRun simple commands using Bolt\n\nGet started\nIn this quest, you will install Puppet Bolt and run some introductory commands.\nAs described in the previous quest, Bolt is a task runner that enables you\nto invoke commands on one or more target nodes. It is well-suited to\nperforming actions in an ad hoc manner instead of managing a node on a\nlong-term basis.\nReady to get started? Run the following command on your Learning VM to begin\nthis quest:\nquest begin hello_bolt\nInstall Puppet Bolt\nTask 1:\n\nPre-built Bolt packages are available for various Red Hat Enterprise Linux,\nSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora distributions, as well as Windows and macOS.\nThe Learning VM is based on a CentOS (Red Hat Enterprise Linux equivalent)\n7 image, so run the following command to configure the Puppet YUM repository:\nrpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6/puppet6-release-el-7.noarch.rpm\nNOTE: If your Learning VM is configured with a host-only network, the\nprevious command will fail, but the puppet-bolt package has been cached for\nconvenience.\nNow run this command to install Bolt:\nyum install puppet-bolt\nVerify the Puppet Bolt installation\nTask 2:\n\nNow that you have installed Puppet Bolt successfully, let&#39;s run some commands\nto verify that it works correctly.\nbolt --help\n\nbolt --version\nTask 3:\n\nBolt provides a command-line interface for running commands, scripts, tasks\nand plans on the local machine or remote nodes. Now let&#39;s practice running some\nsimple commands:\nbolt command run &#39;free -th&#39; --nodes localhost\nThis command shows a human-readable report of the total memory allocated to\nthe local machine, how much is used and how much is free. The output should\nlook something like this:\nStarted on localhost...\nFinished on localhost:\n  STDOUT:\n                  total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available\n    Mem:           3.7G        2.3G        143M        183M        1.2G        878M\n    Swap:          1.0G         10M        1.0G\n    Total:         4.7G        2.3G        1.1G\nSuccessful on 1 node: localhost\nRan on 1 node in 0.01 seconds\nThis demonstrates trivial usage of bolt, but since the command is running on\nthe local machine, you could just as easily run free -th to get the same\noutput.\nBolt is better suited to running commands on one or more remote nodes so the\noutput can be collected and potentially acted upon by another tool. And instead\nof using a tool like ssh in a for loop, you provide a list of nodes to Bolt,\nand it will connect to each one and run the desired command. Now let&#39;s\ntry some examples using a Docker-hosted machine as target node:\nbolt command run hostname --nodes docker://bolt.puppet.vm\n\nbolt command run &#39;cat /etc/hosts&#39; --nodes docker://bolt.puppet.vm\nThe output from these commands will look similar to the following:\nStarted on bolt.puppet.vm...\nFinished on bolt.puppet.vm:\n  STDOUT:\n    bolt.puppet.vm\nSuccessful on 1 node: docker://bolt.puppet.vm\nRan on 1 node in 0.05 seconds\nStarted on bolt.puppet.vm...\nFinished on bolt.puppet.vm:\n  STDOUT:\n    127.0.0.1   localhost\n    ::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\n    fe00::0     ip6-localnet\n    ff00::0     ip6-mcastprefix\n    ff02::1     ip6-allnodes\n    ff02::2     ip6-allrouters\n    172.18.0.1  learning.puppetlabs.vm puppet\n    172.18.0.2  bolt.puppet.vm bolt\nSuccessful on 1 node: docker://bolt.puppet.vm\nRan on 1 node in 0.05 seconds\nPerhaps you want to generate machine-parseable output.

Clarke\n\n\nThis quest kicks off a hands-on introduction to managing infrastructure with\nPuppet tools and services. You&#39;ll start by installing the agent and learning\nsome of the core ideas involved in managing infrastructure. Once the agent is\ninstalled on a new system, you will use the puppet resource tool to explore\nthe state of that system. Through this tool, you will learn about resources,\nthe basic units that Puppet uses to describe and manage a system.\nReady to get started? Run the following command on your Learning VM to begin\nthis quest:\nquest begin hello_puppet\nWhat is Puppet?\nBefore getting into the details of the Puppet tools and how to use them, let&#39;s\ndiscuss what Puppet is and why it&#39;s worth learning. The term Puppet is often\nused as a shorthand for a collection of tools and services that work in\nconcert to help define your infrastructure configuration and then automate\nthe process of bringing the systems into their desired state and keeping them\nthere.\nContinuing with this guide, you&#39;ll dive deeper into individual components\nof the software, but for now there are key points that\ndistinguish its approach from the other tools you might use to manage\nyour systems.\nUsing Puppet, you define a desired state for all systems in your\ninfrastructure. Once this state is defined, it automates the process of\nbringing your systems into that state and keeping them there.\nThis desired state for your systems is written in Puppet code, a domain specific\nlanguage (DSL). This infrastructure as code approach means that users\nconcerned with version control, compliance, continuous integration and\ndeployment, and testing can easily fold infrastructure into their development\nand release workflow.\nPuppet code is a declarative language, which means that you describe only\nthe desired state for your systems, not the steps needed to get there. Once\nyou&#39;ve specified in code those aspects of a system you want Puppet to\nmanage, an agent service running in the background makes any changes\nneeded to bring the system into compliance with the desired state.\nA declarative approach requires that you think about the systems in your\ninfrastructure differently than you would if you were using scripts, golden\nimages, or runbooks. You can focus on what your infrastructure can do for\nyou rather than how you&#39;re going to get there.\nThe declarative Puppet language gives you a single syntax for describing\ndesired state across Windows and Unix-like operating systems, network devices,\nand containers. You don&#39;t have to switch languages and toolsets every time you\nstart work on a new system. Learning Puppet gives you a skillset that can be\ncarried across projects and roles.\nWith a master-agent architecture, there&#39;s no need to connect to systems\nindividually to make changes. Once the agent service is running on a system,\nit periodically establishes a secure connection to the master, fetches\nany code you&#39;ve applied to it, and makes the changes necessary to bring\nthe system in line with the desired state. The fact that\ncentralized control is built in from Puppet&#39;s foundations makes monitoring and\ncompliance much easier.\nThe Puppet agent\nAs we noted above, Puppet is actually a variety of tools and\nservices that work together to help you manage and coordinate the systems in\nyour infrastructure. Though this ecosystem gives you a great degree of power\nand control, the complexity can leave a new user wondering where to start.\nBy initially introducing Bolt, and now the Puppet agent and some of the\ncommand line tools included in\nthe agent installation, there should be a balance between the\nbig-picture view of Puppet and the the bottom-up fundamentals. You&#39;ll begin to\nunderstand the agent&#39;s role in the broader Puppet architecture, as well as the\ndetails of how it interacts with the system where it&#39;s installed.\nThe Puppet agent runs on every system that you want Puppet to manage. The\nagent serves as the bridge between the system where it&#39;s installed and the\nPuppet master server. The agent communicates in two directions: out to the\nmaster to see how its system should be configured, and then inward to native\nsystem tools to check the actual state of the system and to make changes\nto bring it in line with the desired state.\nWhen you install the Puppet agent you get a set of command-line tools that help\nyou interact directly with a system in the same way the Puppet agent does.\nUsing these tools will help you understand how the Puppet agent sees and\nmodifies the state of the system where it&#39;s running.\nAgent installation\nThe Learning VM itself has Puppet Enterprise\npre-installed, including the Puppet master service. For each quest, the quest\ntool provides one or more agent systems that you explore and configure\nwith Puppet.\nFor this quest, there is a fresh system where you can install the Puppet\nagent and explore some of the tools it provides. The Puppet master hosts an\nagent install script that makes it easy to install the Puppet agent on any\nsystem that can access the master.\nTask 1:\n\nTo get started, use the bolt tool that was introduced in the previous quest. Copy and run the following command to\nload the agent installer from the master and run it on the agent system:\nbolt command run &quot;sh -c &#39;curl -k https://learning.puppetlabs.vm:8140/packages/current/install.bash | sudo bash&#39;&quot; --nodes docker://hello.puppet.vm\nYou will see text stream across the screen as the installation runs.\nYou can find full documentation of the agent installation process, including specific\ninstructions for Windows and other operating systems in the installation\ndocumentation.\nResources\nAs noted above, the Puppet agent comes with a set of supporting tools you\ncan use to explore your system. Now that the agent is\ninstalled, use these tools to see what they can teach you about how\nPuppet works.\nOne of Puppet&#39;s core concepts is the resource abstraction layer. For Puppet, \neach aspect of the system you want to manage (such as a\nuser, file, service, or package) is represented in code as a unit called\na resource. The puppet resource tool lets you view and modify these\nresources directly.\nTask 2:\n\nUsing the following command, connect to the system where the agent was just installed. Enter the password puppet when prompted.\nssh learning@hello.puppet.vm\nNext run the following command to ask Puppet to describe a file resource:\nsudo puppet resource file /tmp/test\nWhat you see is the Puppet code representation of a resource. In this case,\nthe resource&#39;s type is file, and its path is\n/tmp/test:\nfile { &#39;/tmp/test&#39;:\n  ensure =&gt; &#39;absent&#39;,\n}\n\nThe resource syntax can be broken down into its components so its\nanatomy can be understood a little more clearly.\ntype { &#39;title&#39;:\n  parameter =&gt; &#39;value&#39;,\n}\n\nThe type is the kind of thing the resource describes. It can be a core\ntype like a user, file, service, or package, or a custom type that you\nhave implemented yourself or installed from a module. \nCustom types\ndescribe resources that might be specific to a service or application (for\nexample, an Apache vhost or MySQL database) that Puppet doesn&#39;t know about out\nof the box.\nThe body of a resource is a list of parameter value pairs that follow the\npattern parameter =&gt; value. The parameters and possible values vary from type\nto type. They specify the state of the resource on the system. Documentation\nfor resource parameters is provided in the Resource Type\nReference.\nThe resource title is a unique name that Puppet uses to identify the\nresource internally. In the case of the file resource above, the\nresource&#39;s title was the path of the file on the system: /tmp/test. Each\nresource type has a unique identifying feature that can be used as the resource\ntitle. A user resource uses the account name as a title, for example, and\na package resource uses the name of the package you want to manage.\nNow that you&#39;re more familiar with the resource syntax, take another look\nat that file resource.\nfile { &#39;/tmp/test&#39;:\n  ensure =&gt; &#39;absent&#39;,\n}\n\nNotice that it has a single parameter value pair: ensure =&gt; &#39;absent&#39;. The\nensure parameter tells us the basic state of a resource. For the file type,\nthis parameter describes if the file exists on the system and if it does,\nwhether it&#39;s a normal file, a directory, or a link.\nTask 3:\n\nPuppet is indicating that this file doesn&#39;t exist. So what happens when\nyou use the touch command to create a new empty file at that path? Run:\ntouch /tmp/test\nUse the puppet resource tool to see how this change is represented in\nPuppet&#39;s resource syntax:\nsudo puppet resource file /tmp/test\nNow that the file exists on the system, Puppet has more to say about it. It\nshows the ensure and content parameters and their values,\nplus information about the file&#39;s owner, when it was created, and\nwhen it was last modified.\nfile { &#39;/tmp/test&#39;:\n  ensure  =&gt; &#39;file&#39;,\n  content =&gt; &#39;{md5}d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e&#39;,\n  ...\n}\n\nThe value of the content parameter might not be what you expected. When the\npuppet resource tool interprets a file in this resource declaration syntax,\nit converts the content to an MD5 hash. Puppet uses the hash to quickly\ncompare the actual content of a file on your system against the expected\ncontent to see if has changed.\nTask 4:\n\nNext, use the puppet resource tool to add some content to our file.\nRunning puppet resource with a parameter=value argument tells Puppet to\nmodify the resource on the system to match the value you set. (Note that while\nthis is a great way to test out changes in a development environment, it&#39;s not\na good way to manage production infrastructure.\nRun the following command:\nsudo puppet resource file /tmp/test content=&#39;Hello Puppet!&#39;\nPuppet will display some output as it checks the hash of the existing content\nagainst the new content you provided. When it sees that the hashes don&#39;t match,\nit sets the file&#39;s content to the value of the command&#39;s content parameter.\nLook at the file to see the modified content by running:\ncat /tmp/test\nTypes and Providers\nThis translation back and forth between the state of the system and Puppet&#39;s\nresource syntax is the heart of Puppet&#39;s resource abstraction layer. To get\na better understanding of how this works, let&#39;s take a look at another resource\ntype, the package.\nTask 5:\n\nAs an example, run the following command to install the package for the\nApache webserver httpd:\nsudo puppet resource package httpd\nBecause this package doesn&#39;t exist on the system, Puppet shows you the\nensure =&gt; purged parameter value pair. This purged value is similar to the\nabsent value you saw earlier for the file resource, but in the case of the\npackage resource, indicates that both the package itself and any configuration\nfiles installed by the package manager are both absent.\npackage { &#39;httpd&#39;:\n  ensure =&gt; &#39;purged&#39;,\n}\n\nEach resource type has a set of providers. A\nprovider is the translation layer that sits between Puppet&#39;s resource\nrepresentation and the native system tools it uses to discover and modify the\nunderlying system state. Each resource type generally has a variety of\ndifferent providers.\nThe quickest way to see the inner workings of a provider\nis to break it. Tell Puppet to install a nonexistent package named\nbogus-package by running:\nsudo puppet resource package bogus-package ensure=present\nThe error message tells you that yum wasn&#39;t able to find the\nspecified package, and lists the command that Puppet&#39;s yum provider tried to\nrun when it saw that the package wasn&#39;t already installed:\nError: Execution of &#39;/bin/yum -d 0 -e 0 -y install bogus-package&#39; returned 1:\nError Nothing to do\nPuppet selects a default provider based on the agent&#39;s operating system and\nwhether the commands associated with that provider are available. You\ncan override this default by setting a resource&#39;s provider parameter.\nTry installing the same fake package again, this time with the gem\nprovider:\n sudo puppet resource package bogus-package ensure=present provider=gem\nYou&#39;ll see a similar error with a failed gem command instead of the yum\ncommand:\nError: Execution of &#39;/bin/gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri bogus-package&#39;\nreturned 2: ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem &#39;bogus-package&#39; (&gt;= 0) in any repository\nError: /Package[bogus-package]/ensure: change from absent to present failed: \nExecution of &#39;/bin/gem install --no-rdoc --no-ri bogus-package&#39; returned 2: \nERROR:  Could not find a valid gem &#39;bogus-package&#39; (&gt;= 0) in any repository\nNow that you know what&#39;s happening in the background, try installing\na real package with the default provider:\nsudo puppet resource package httpd ensure=present\nThis time, Puppet installs the package. The value of the\nensure parameter shows you the specific version of the installed package:\npackage { &#39;httpd&#39;:\n  ensure =&gt; &#39;2.4.6-45.el7.centos&#39;,\n}\n\nWhen you don&#39;t specify a version of the package to install, Puppet\ndefaults to installing the latest available version and displays this version\nnumber as the value of the ensure attribute.\nNow that you&#39;ve had a chance to explore this system with the newly installed\nPuppet agent, exit to return to the Puppet master before you continue to the\nnext quest.\nexit\nReview\nIn this quest, you learned what Puppet is and some of the advantages of\nmanaging your infrastructure with Puppet&#39;s declarative domain-specific\nlanguage and master-agent architecture.\nYou installed the Puppet agent on a new system using Bolt. Once the agent and suite of\nsupporting tools were installed, you learned the fundamentals of Puppet&#39;s\nresource abstraction layer, including resources, resource\ntypes, and the providers that translate between your Puppet code and\nthe native system tools.\nNow that you&#39;ve learned some of the core concepts behind Puppet, you&#39;re ready\nto use these ideas in a more realistic workflow. The puppet\nresource command is a great way to explore a system or test Puppet code, but\nit&#39;s not the tool you&#39;ll be using to automate your configuration management.\nIn the next quest, you&#39;ll learn how to save Puppet code to a file called a\nmanifest and organize it into a module within your Puppet master&#39;s\ncodedir. This structure lets Puppet keep track of where to find all the\nresources it needs to manage your infrastructure.\nAnd you&#39;ll see how the Puppet agent communicates with your Puppet master to\nfetch a compiled list of resources called a catalog based on Puppet code\nkept on the master.\nAdditional Resources\n\nWatch our on-demand webinar &quot;Introduction to Puppet Enterprise&quot;\nRead about installing Puppet Enterprise on our docs page\nTake a look at our What is Puppet and What is Puppet Enterprise and Resources self-paced lessons.\nPuppet basics are covered in-depth in our Getting Started with Puppet course.

While\nexploring and manipulating resources through Puppet&#39;s command line tools are\nuseful, the real value of the resource abstraction layer is to provide a single\ncommon language for your Puppet master to manage all the systems in your\ninfrastructure.\nIn this quest, we&#39;ll walk through a Puppet agent run to demonstrate how the\nPuppet agent communicates with the Puppet master server. We&#39;ll then write some\nPuppet code to a manifest on the Puppet master to begin defining a desired\nstate for our agent system.\nReady to get started? Run the following command on your Learning VM:\nquest begin agent_run\nThe agent/master architecture\nAs we mentioned in the previous quest, Puppet is typically used in what&#39;s\ncalled an agent/master (client/server) architecture.\nIn this architecture, each managed node in your infrastructure runs a Puppet\nagent service. One or more servers (depending on the size and complexity of\nyour infrastructure) act as Puppet master(s) and run the Puppet server\nservice to handle communication with your agents. In a default monolithic\nmaster installation, the Puppet master server also hosts several supporting\nservices such as the PE console services and PuppetDB. In larger deployments\nthese services may be distributed across other servers to improve performance\nand provide redundancy.\nBy default, the Puppet agent service initiates a Puppet run every half-hour.\nThis periodic run ensures that your system stays in the desired state you\ndescribed in your Puppet code. Any configuration drift that occurs between runs\nis remediated the next time the agent runs.\nWe&#39;ve disabled these automatic runs on the Learning VM&#39;s agent systems.\nInstead, you&#39;ll manually trigger runs to get more control and visibility as you\nlearn how Puppet works.\n\nThe Puppet agent begins a Puppet run by sending a catalog request to the\nPuppet master. This request includes some information about the agent system\nprovided by a tool called Facter.\nThe Puppet master uses this information from Facter along with your Puppet code\nto compile a catalog that tells the agent exactly how the resources on its\nsystem should be configured.\nYour Puppet master keeps a copy of the Puppet codebase you&#39;ve created to define\nthe desired state for systems in your infrastructure. This Puppet code is\nprimarily made up of resource declarations like the ones you saw in the\nprevious quest. While your Puppet code&#39;s final purpose is to define resources,\nit also includes some language features such as variables, classes, and\nconditionals that can give you control over which resources you want on a\nsystem and how their parameters are set. The master parses this code to create\na catalog. The catalog is the final list of system resources that\ndefine the desired state for an agent node.\nThe Puppet master sends this catalog back to the Puppet agent, which then uses\nits providers to check if the desired state of each resource defined in the\ncatalog matches the actual state of the resource on the system. If any\ndifferences are found, the providers help Puppet implement whatever changes are\nnecessary to bring the actual state of the system into line with the desired\nstate defined in the catalog.\nFinally, the Puppet agent generates a report that includes information about\nunchanged resources, successful changes, and any errors it may have encountered\nduring the run. It sends this report back to the Puppet master, which stores\nit in PuppetDB and makes it available via the PE console&#39;s web GUI.\nCertificates\nThere&#39;s one more thing to note before we can move on to demonstrating a Puppet\nagent run.\nAll communications between an agent and master happen over SSL. Before the\nmaster communicates with an agent, it needs a way to validate that the agent\nnode is authentic. This prevents unauthorized connections from spoofing\nan agent node to access sensitive data that might be included in a\ncatalog. While Puppet does provide options for encrypting\ndata within a\ncatalog, it&#39;s best to control which systems can make a catalog request in the\nfirst place.\nPuppet requires any system contacting the Puppet master to\nauthenticate with a signed certificate. The first time a Puppet agent contacts\nthe Puppet master, it will submit a certificate signing request (CSR). A\nPuppet administrator can then validate that the system sending the CSR should\nbe allowed to request catalogs from the master before deciding to sign the\ncertificate. (You can read more about the details of Puppet&#39;s cryptographic\nsecurity and the certification system on the docs\npage)\nTask 1:\n\nStart by connecting to your agent system. When you\nbegan this quest, the system you used in the last quest was destroyed and a new\none was created. This new system has the Puppet agent pre-installed, so there&#39;s\nno need to repeat the installation process. Go ahead and connect to the new\nagent system with the same credentials you used in the last quest:\nusername: learningpassword: puppet\nssh learning@agent.puppet.vm\nFirst, try to trigger a Puppet agent run without your agent system&#39;s certificate\nsigned. The agent will attempt to contact the Puppet master, but its request\nwill be rejected.\nsudo puppet agent -t\nYou&#39;ll see a notification like the following:\nExiting; no certificate found and waitforcert is disabled\nNo problem: you just have to sign the certificate. For now, we&#39;ll show you how\nto do it from the command line. If you prefer a GUI, the PE console includes\ntools for certificate\nmanagement.\nTask 2:\n\nFirst, exit your SSH session to return to the your Puppet master:\nexit\nUse the puppetserver ca tool to list unsigned certificates:\npuppetserver ca list\nSign the cert for agent.puppet.vm:\npuppetserver ca sign --certname agent.puppet.vm\nTask 3:\n\nWith that taken care of, your Puppet agent is authorized to make catalog\nrequests.\nTriggering a Puppet run\nAs noted above, the default for the Puppet agent service is to initiate a\nPuppet run every thirty minutes. Because it would be hard to clearly demonstrate Puppet\nwith these scheduled background runs, we&#39;ve disabled the Puppet agent\nservice on your agent system. Instead, you can use the puppet agent -t\ncommand to manually trigger a run.\nGo ahead and connect to your agent node:\nssh learning@agent.puppet.vm\nTrigger an agent run. Now that the agent&#39;s certificate is signed, it will\nreceive a catalog from the Puppet master.\nsudo puppet agent -t\nWhile you haven&#39;t yet told Puppet to manage any resources on the system, you&#39;ll\nsee a lot of text scroll by. Most of what you see is a process called\npluginsync.\nDuring pluginsync, any extensions installed on the master (such as custom\nfacts, resource types, or providers) are copied to the Puppet agent before the\nPuppet run continues. This ensures that the agent has all the tools it needs to\ncorrectly apply the catalog.\nThis pluginsync process adds a lot of clutter, but we&#39;ll focus on three lines\nthat look like the following. If you&#39;d like to see these lines with less\nclutter, trigger another agent run.\nInfo: Loading facts\nInfo: Caching catalog for agent.puppet.vm\nInfo: Applying configuration version &#39;1464919481&#39;\nThis output shows you one side of the conversation between the agent and master\nwe discussed at the beginning of this quest.\nYou see that the Puppet agent loads the facts it needs to share the details\nof the system where it&#39;s running with the Puppet master.\nNext, you see when the agent has received a catalog because it tells you when it caches a copy of the new catalog. (The Puppet agent can be\nconfigured to fail over to this cached catalog if it is unable to connect to\nthe master.)\nFinally, the Puppet agent applies the catalog. Normally after this step, you would see a list\nof all the changes made by the agent. In this case,\nhowever, the Puppet master didn&#39;t find any Puppet code to apply to your agent\nnode, and it didn&#39;t make any changes (other than those involved in pluginsync)\nduring this run.\nClassification\nTo make something more interesting happen, you&#39;ll have to specify a desired\nstate for some resources on the agent.puppet.vm system.\nTask 4:\n\nRemember, the Puppet code you use to describe how you want a node to be\nconfigured is kept on the Puppet master. End your SSH session on the\nagent.puppet.vm agent node to return to the Puppet master:\nexit\nBefore diving in and writing some Puppet code, let&#39;s take a moment to go over\nthe catalog compilation process from the Puppet master&#39;s perspective. This will\nhelp you understand exactly what you&#39;re doing as you write code to apply to\nyour agent.\nWhen the Puppet server service on the Puppet master receives a catalog\nrequest with a valid certificate, it begins a process called node\nclassification to determine what Puppet code will be compiled to generate\na catalog for the agent making the request.\nThere are three different ways to handle node classification.\n\nThe site.pp manifest is a special file on the master where you can write\nnode definitions. This is the method we&#39;ll be using now and in several of the\nfollowing quests. It gives you the most direct view of how node classification\nworks.\n\nThe PE console includes a GUI node classifier that makes it easy to manage\nnode groups and classification without editing code directly. Though this is a\nvery efficient way to manage node classification, you&#39;ll understand it best after you&#39;re familiar with some of the underlying Puppet concepts.\n\nFinally, if you want to customize node classification, you can create your\nown external node\nclassifier. An external\nnode classifier can be any executable that takes the name of a node as an\nargument and returns a YAML file describing the Puppet code to be applied to\nthat node. This is an advanced topic and is not covered in this guide.\n\n\nThe site.pp manifest\nWhen a Puppet agent contacts the Puppet master, the master checks for any node\ndefinitions in the site.pp manifest that match the agent system&#39;s name. In\nthe Puppet world, the term &quot;node&quot; is used to mean any system or device in your\ninfrastructure, so a node definition defines how Puppet should manage a given\nsystem.\nIt will help to understand what a node definition looks like with an example.\nGo ahead and open your site.pp manifest:\nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp\nScroll past the comments and default node definition to the bottom of the file.\n(In Vim, you can type G to jump the the bottom of a file) This is where\nyou&#39;ll create a new node definition for the agent.puppet.vm system. The\noutline of the node definition should look like this:\nnode &#39;agent.puppet.vm&#39; {\n\n}\n\nNormally you would include one or more class declarations in this node block. A\nclass defines a group of related resources, allowing them to be declared as a\nsingle unit. Using classes in your node definitions keeps them simple and well\norganized and encourages the reuse of code. We&#39;ll cover the details of classes\nin the next quest. For now, however, we&#39;ll take a shortcut and write a resource\ndeclaration directly into your node definition. In this case, use a resource\ntype called notify that will display a message in the output of your Puppet\nrun without making any changes to the system.\nAdd the following notify resource to your node definition. (You&#39;ll probably\nlearn Puppet code syntax more quickly if you type out your code manually, but\nif you prefer to paste content into Vim, you can hit ESC to enter command\nmode and type :set paste to disable the automatic formatting. Press i to\nreturn to insert mode before pasting your text.)\nnode &#39;agent.puppet.vm&#39; {\n  notify { &#39;Hello Puppet!&#39;: }\n}\n\nRemember, use ESC then :wq to save your file and exit Vim.\nYou may notice that this resource declaration doesn&#39;t include any parameters.\nThe only feature of this notify resource we care about is the message it\ndisplays. If it&#39;s not set explicitly by the message parameter, this message\nwill default to the resource title. This lets us save some time by leaving out\nthe parameter value pairs and using the title to define the message we want the\nresource to display. (This parameter that uses the resource title as its\ndefault is called a namevar. You can read more about the role of the\nnamevar in the Puppet docs)\nNow that you have a concrete example of a node declaration, let&#39;s return to our\nreview of the agent run process from the master&#39;s perspective. When the agent\ncontacts the master, the master finds a matching node definition in the\nsite.pp manifest and uses the Puppet code contained in that node definition\nto compile a catalog.\nThe master sends that compiled catalog to the agent, which then applies the\ncatalog to the system where it&#39;s running. In this case, the catalog only\nincludes a notify resource, so the agent will display the specified message\nas it applies the catalog, but no changes will be made to the system.\nTask 5:\n\nNow that you have some Puppet code for the master to parse and return to the\nagent, trigger another Puppet run.\nSSH to your agent node:\nssh learning@agent.puppet.vm\nUse the puppet agent tool to trigger a Puppet run:\nsudo puppet agent -t\nThe output will include something like this:\nNotice: Hello Puppet!\nNotice: /Stage[main]/Main/Node[agent.puppet.vm]/Notify[Hello Puppet!]/message: defined &#39;message&#39; as &#39;Hello Puppet!&#39;\nNotice: Applied catalog in 0.45 seconds\nNow disconnect from your agent node.\nexit\nReview\nWe began this quest with a discussion of Puppet&#39;s agent/master architecture\nand the communication between the Puppet master and an agent. The agent begins\nthis process by sending a catalog request to the master. The master first\nchecks to see if the agent has a valid certificate. If the certificate is\nvalid, the master consults several methods of classification to begin the\nprocess of catalog compilation. In this quest, we used a node definition\nin the site.pp manifest to classify our node. The master then compiles a\ncatalog that it returns to the agent. The agent checks if the current state\nof its system matches the desired state described in the catalog and makes\nany changes necessary to bring it in line. For the sake of simplicity in this\nquest, we used a notify resource to display a message rather than make\nany changes to the system. Once the agent has applied the catalog (or failed to\napply the catalog if an error occurs), it sends a report of the run&#39;s results\nback to the master, which stores it in the PuppetDB.\nNow that we&#39;ve introduced the resource abstraction layer, the agent/master\ncommunication involved in a Puppet run, and a simple example of classification\nwith the site.pp manifest, you&#39;ve seen the foundations that the rest of\nPuppet is built on.\nAdditional Resources\n\nRead about the basics of a Puppet agent run on our docs page\nPuppet agent concepts are covered in-depth in our Getting Started with Puppet course.

Though some of the examples we give\nhere may seem overly complex given the simplicity of what we&#39;re managing,\nstarting with good design will keep everything working smoothly as you start\nmanaging a more complex Puppet infrastructure.\nIn this quest, you&#39;ll learn how Puppet code is organized into manifests,\nclasses, and modules, and how to apply classes to nodes with the\nsite.pp manifest. These basics will give you a solid foundation when\nyou begin to work with more complex code management methods for your Puppet\ncode.\nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, enter the following command:\nquest begin manifests_and_classes\nManifests\n\nImagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality.\n-James Cameron\n\nAt its simplest, a Puppet manifest is Puppet code saved to a file with the\n.pp extension. This code is written in the Puppet domain specific\nlanguage (DSL). You already saw some examples of this DSL as you learned\nabout resources. The Puppet DSL includes resource declarations, along with a set\nof other language features, that let you control which resources are applied on\na system and what values are set for those resources&#39; parameters.\nTask 1:\n\nGo ahead and ssh to the node we&#39;ve created for this quest. Remember, the\npassword for this and all the agent systems you&#39;ll use in this Quest Guide is\npuppet.\nssh learning@cowsay.puppet.vm\nCreate a throw-away manifest in our /tmp/ directory to see how this works. \nvim /tmp/hello.pp\nUse the same notify resource declaration you included in your site.pp in the\nprevious quest:\nnotify { &#39;Hello Puppet!&#39;: }\n\n(Remember, use ESC then :wq to save and exit.)\nRather than classifying this node on the master and triggering a Puppet agent\nrun, apply this manifest directly with the puppet apply tool. You can use the\npuppet apply tool to test Puppet code in a manifest just like you can use the \npuppet resource tool to explore and modify resources directly.\nsudo puppet apply /tmp/hello.pp \nNow you know how to save Puppet code to a file, but how do you bridge the gap\nbetween this saved Puppet code and the site.pp manifest where you define\nnode classification? The first step is to organize your Puppet code into\nclasses and modules.\nClasses and modules\nA class is named block of Puppet code. Defining a class\ncombines a group of resources into single reusable and configurable unit. Once\ndefined, a class can then be declared to tell Puppet to apply the\nresources it contains.\nA class should bring together a set of resources that manage one logical\ncomponent of a system. For example, a class written to manage a MS SQL Server\nmight include resources to manage the package, configuration files, and service\nfor the MS SQL Server instance. Because each of these components relies on the\nothers, it makes sense to manage them together. You&#39;re not likely to want a server with\nMS SQL configuration files without the MS SQL application package itself.\nA module is a directory structure that lets Puppet keep track of where to\nfind the manifests that contain your classes. A module also contains other data\na class might rely on, such as the templates for configuration files. When you\napply a class to a node, the Puppet master checks in a list of directories\ncalled a modulepath for a module directory matching the class name. The master then\nlooks in that module&#39;s manifests subdirectory to find the manifest containing\nthe class definition. It reads the Puppet code contained in that class\ndefinition and uses it to compile a catalog defining a desired state for the\nnode.\nAll this will be much easier to understand with an example in front of you.\nLet&#39;s dive in and write a simple module.\nWrite a cowsay module\nBy way of example, we&#39;ll write a module to manage a small program called\ncowsay. Cowsay lets you print a message inside a speech bubble coming from the\nmouth of an ASCII cow.\nBefore you create a new manifest, you need to know where to keep it. For Puppet\nto find your code, you need to place it in a module directory in Puppet&#39;s\nmodulepath.\nIf you&#39;re still connected to cowsay.puppet.vm disconnect to return to your\nmaster system.\nexit\nTo see what your configured modulepath is, run the following command:\npuppet config print modulepath\nThe output is a list of directories separated by the colon (:) character.\n/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules:/etc/puppetlabs/code/modules:/opt/puppetlabs/puppet/modules\nFor now, we&#39;ll work in the first directory listed in the modulepath. This\ndirectory includes modules specific to the production environment. (The second directory\ncontains modules used across all environments, and the third is modules that PE\nuses to configure itself).\nBecause we&#39;re focusing on the structure of your module and class, we&#39;ll be\nwriting our code directly to the modulepath on the master. In a real production\nenvironment, however, you would likely want to keep your Puppet code in a\nversion control repository such as Git and use Puppet&#39;s code manager tool to\ndeploy it to your master. Because we don&#39;t have any critical infrastructure\nrelying on the VM, we can safely skip this step and dive right into the code.\nTask 2:\n\nUse cd to navigate to the modules directory.\ncd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules\nCreate a directory structure for a new module called cowsay. (The -p\nflag allows you to create the cowsay parent directory and manifests\nsubdirectory at once.)\nmkdir -p cowsay/manifests\nWith this directory structure in place, it&#39;s time to create the manifest where\nwe&#39;ll write the cowsay class.\nTask 3:\n\nUse vim to create an init.pp manifest in your module&#39;s manifests directory.\nvim cowsay/manifests/init.pp\nIf this manifest is going to contain the cowsay class, you might be wondering\nwhy we&#39;re calling it init.pp instead of cowsay.pp. Most modules contain a\nmain class like this whose name corresponds with the name of the module itself.\nThis main class is always kept in a manifest with the special name init.pp.\nEnter the following class definition, then save and exit (:wq):\nclass cowsay {\n  package { &#39;cowsay&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n  }\n}\n\n(Notice that we&#39;ve specified gem as the provider for this package. Apparently\ncowsay isn&#39;t important enough to live in any of the default yum package\nrepositories, so we&#39;re telling Puppet to use the gem provider to install a\nversion of the package written in Ruby and published on RubyGems.)\nIt&#39;s always good practice to validate your code before you try to apply it. Use\nthe puppet parser tool to check the syntax of your new manifest.\npuppet parser validate cowsay/manifests/init.pp\nThe parser will return nothing if there are no errors. If it does detect a\nsyntax error, open the file again and fix the problem before continuing. Be\naware that this validation can only catch simple syntax errors and won&#39;t let\nyou know about other possible errors in your manifests.\nNow that the cowsay class is defined in your module&#39;s init.pp manifest,\nyour Puppet master knows exactly where to find the appropriate Puppet code when\nyou apply the cowsay class to a node.\nTask 4:\n\nIn the setup for this quest, the quest tool prepared a cowsay.puppet.vm\nnode. Let&#39;s apply the cowsay class to this node. First, open your site.pp\nmanifest.\nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp\nAt the end of the site.pp manifest, insert the following code:\nnode &#39;cowsay.puppet.vm&#39; {\n  include cowsay\n}\n\nSave and exit.\nThis include cowsay line tells the Puppet master to parse the contents of the\ncowsay class when it compiles a catalog for the cowsay.puppet.vm node.\nTask 5:\n\nNow that you&#39;ve added the cowsay class to your classification for the\ncowsay.puppet.vm node, let&#39;s connect to that node and trigger a Puppet agent\nrun to see the changes applied.\nssh learning@cowsay.puppet.vm\nBefore applying any changes to your system, it&#39;s always a good idea to use the\n--noop flag to do a practice run of the Puppet agent. This will compile the\ncatalog and notify you of the changes that Puppet would have made without\nactually applying any of those changes to your system. It&#39;s a good way to catch\nissues the puppet parser validate command can&#39;t detect, and gives you a\nchance to validate that Puppet will be making the changes you expect.\nsudo puppet agent -t --noop\nYou should see an output like the following:\nNotice: Compiled catalog for cowsay.puppet.vm in environment production in\n0.62 seconds\nNotice: /Stage[main]/Cowsay/Package[cowsay]/ensure: current_value\nabsent, should be present (noop)\nNotice: Class[Cowsay]: Would have triggered &#39;refresh&#39; from 1\nevents\nNotice: Stage[main]: Would have triggered &#39;refresh&#39; from 1 events\nNotice: Finished catalog run in 1.08 seconds\nIf your dry run looks good, go ahead and run the Puppet agent again without the\n--noop flag.\nsudo puppet agent -t\nNow you can try out your newly installed cowsay command:\ncowsay Puppet is awesome!\nYour bovine friend clearly knows what&#39;s up.\n ____________________\n&lt; Puppet is awesome! &gt;\n --------------------\n        \\   ^__^\n         \\  (oo)\\_______\n            (__)\\       )\\/\\\n                ||----w |\n                ||     ||\nComposed classes and class scope\nA module often includes multiple components that work together to serve a\nsingle function. Cowsay alone is great, but many users don&#39;t have the time to\nwrite out a custom high-quality message on each execution of the command. For\nthis reason, cowsay is often used in conjunction with the fortune command,\nwhich provides you and your cow with a database of sayings and wisdom to draw\non.\nTask 6:\n\nDisconnect from the cowsay.puppet.vm node to return to your master.\nexit\nCreate a new manifest for your fortune class definition.\nvim cowsay/manifests/fortune.pp\nWrite your class definition here:\nclass cowsay::fortune {\n  package { &#39;fortune-mod&#39;:\n    ensure =&gt; present,\n  }\n}\n\nNote that unlike the main init.pp manifest, the filename of the manifest\nshows us the name of the class it defines. In fact, because this class is\ncontained in the cowsay module, its full name is cowsay::fortune.  The two\ncolons that connect cowsay and fortune are pronounced &quot;scope scope&quot; and\nindicate that this fortune class is contained in the cowsay module scope.\nNotice how the fully scoped name of the class tells Puppet exactly where to\nfind it in your module path: the fortune.pp manifest in the cowsay module&#39;s\nmanifests directory. This naming pattern also helps avoid conflicts among\nsimilarly named classes provided by different modules.\nTask 7:\n\nAgain, validate your new manifest&#39;s syntax with the puppet parser validate\ncommand.\npuppet parser validate cowsay/manifests/fortune.pp\nWe could use another include statement in the site.pp manifest to classify\ncowsay.puppet.vm with this cowsay::fortune class. In general, however, it&#39;s\nbest to keep your classification as simple as possible.\nIn this case, use a class declaration to pull the cowsay::fortune class\ninto our main cowsay class.\nvim cowsay/manifests/init.pp\nAdd an include statement for your cowsay::fortune class to the cowsay class.\nclass cowsay {\n  package { &#39;cowsay&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n  }\n  include cowsay::fortune\n}\n\nUse the puppet parser validate command to check your syntax.\npuppet parser validate cowsay/manifests/init.pp\nTask 8:\n\nReturn to your cowsay.puppet.vm node so we can test out these changes.\nssh learning@cowsay.puppet.vm\nTrigger a Puppet agent run with the --noop flag to check what changes Puppet\nwill make.\nsudo puppet agent -t --noop\nNotice that because the cowsay package is already installed, Puppet\nwon&#39;t make any changes to this package. Now that you&#39;ve included the\ncowsay::fortune package, Puppet knows that it needs to install the\nfortune-mod package to bring your node into the desired state you defined for\nit.\nTrigger another Puppet run without the --noop flag to make these changes.\nsudo puppet agent -t\nNow that you have both packages installed, you can use them together. Try\npiping the output of the fortune command to cowsay.\nfortune | cowsay\nNow that you&#39;ve seen the results of your Puppet run, disconnect to return to\nyour Puppet master.\nexit\nReview\nWe began this quest with a discussion of the importance of keeping your Puppet\ncode well organized. This structure of classes, manifests, and modules\nkeeps your code organized in logical, reusable units. Keeping your modules within\nPuppet&#39;s modulepath allows the Puppet master to find the classes contained\nwithin them.\nUsing what you learned, you created a new module to manage the cowsay\npackage, then extended this module by creating a new class to manage the\nfortune-mod package.\nAs you move ahead in this guide, you will continue to use this organizational\nscheme to structure the Puppet code you write.\nAdditional Resources\n\nModule fundamentals and structure are covered on our docs page, along with other topics such as module testing and publishing to the Forge.\nPuppet modules are covered in-depth in our Getting Started with Puppet and Puppet Practitioner courses.

Often, however, you&#39;ll need Puppet to manage several\nrelated resource types to get your managed system to its desired state. The\npackage, file, and service resource types are used in concert often\nenough that we talk about them together as the &quot;package, file, service&quot;\npattern. A package resource manages the software package itself, a file\nresource allows you to customize a related configuration file, and a service\nresource starts the service provided by the software you&#39;ve just installed and\nconfigured.\nTo give you an example to work with in this and the following quests, we&#39;ve\ncreated a simple Ruby application called Pasture. Pasture provides cowsay&#39;s\nfunctionality over RESTful API so that your cows can be accessible over HTTP—we\nmight call this cowsay as a service (CaaS). (You can find the source code\nhere). Though this Pasture\napplication is whimsical, its simplicity allows us to focus on Puppet itself\nwithout taking detours to cover the features and caveats of a more complex\napplication.\nJust like the cowsay command line tool, we&#39;ll use a package resource with the\ngem provider to install Pasture.\nNext, because Pasture reads from a configuration file, we&#39;re going to use a\nfile resource to manage its settings.\nFinally, we want Pasture to run as a persistent background process, rather than\nrunning once like the cowsay command line tool. It needs to listen for incoming\nrequests and serve out cows as needed. To set this up, we&#39;ll first have to\ncreate a file resource to define the service, then use a service resource\nto ensure that it&#39;s running.\nPackage\nTask 1:\n\nBefore getting started, be sure you&#39;re in your Puppet master&#39;s modules\ndirectory.\ncd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules\nCreate a new directory structure for your pasture module.

If you want a clean prompt for your\nnext command, just hit the enter key.\nTask 6:\n\nUse the curl command to test the Pasture API. The request takes two\nparameters, string, which defines the message to be returned, and\ncharacter, which sets the character you want to speak the message. By\ndefault, the process listens on port 4567. Try the following command:\ncurl &#39;localhost:4567/api/v1/cowsay?message=Hello!&#39;\nBy default, your message will be spoken by the cow character. Let&#39;s try passing\nin another parameter to change this.\ncurl &#39;localhost:4567/api/v1/cowsay?message=Hello!&amp;character=elephant&#39;\nTask 7:\n\nFeel free to experiment with other parameters. When you&#39;re done, use the fg\ncommand to foreground the pasture process:\nfg\nUse the CTRL-C key combination to end the process:  \nCTRL-C  \nIf fg doesn&#39;t foreground the process, use the ps command to find the\npasture process&#39;s PID and use the kill command with that PID (e.g. kill\n5983) to stop the process.\nOnce you&#39;ve stopped the process, disconnect from the agent node.\nexit\nFile\nPackages you install with Puppet often have configuration files that let you\ncustomize their behavior. We&#39;ve written the Pasture gem to use a simple\nconfiguration file. Once you understand the basic concept, it will be easy to\nextend to more complex configurations.\nYou already created a files directory inside the pasture module directory.\nJust like placing manifests inside a module&#39;s manifests directory allows Puppet\nto find the classes they define, placing files in the module&#39;s files directory\nmakes them available to Puppet.\nTask 8:\n\nCreate a pasture_config.yaml file in your module&#39;s files directory.\nvim pasture/files/pasture_config.yaml\nInclude a line here to set the default character to elephant.\n---\n:default_character: elephant\n\nWith this source file saved to your module&#39;s files directory, you can use\nit to define the content of a file resource.\nThe file resource takes a source parameter, which allows you to specify a\nsource file that will define the content of the managed file. As its value,\nthis parameter takes a URI. While it&#39;s possible to point to other locations,\nyou&#39;ll typically use this to specify a file in your module&#39;s files directory.\nPuppet uses a shortened URI format that begins with the puppet: prefix to\nrefer to these module files kept on your Puppet master. This format follows the\npattern puppet:///modules/&lt;MODULE NAME&gt;/&lt;FILE PATH&gt;. Notice the triple\nforward slash just after puppet:. This stands in for the implied path to the\nmodules on your Puppet master.\nDon&#39;t worry if this URI syntax seems complex. It&#39;s pretty rare that you&#39;ll need\nto use it for anything other than referring to files within your modules, so\nthe pattern above is likely all you&#39;ll need to learn. You can always refer back\nto the\ndocs\nfor a reminder.\nTask 9:\n\nReturn to your init.pp manifest.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nAnd add a file resource declaration.\nclass pasture {\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;:\n    source =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n  }\n}\n\nCheck your syntax with the puppet parser tool.\npuppet parser validate pasture/manifests/init.pp\nService\nWhile the cowsay command you installed in the previous quest runs once and\nexits, Pasture is intended to be run as a service. A Pasture process will run\nin the background and listen for any incoming requests on its designated port.\nBecause our agent node is running CentOS 7, we&#39;ll use the systemd service manager to handle our Pasture process.\nAlthough some packages set up their own service unit files, Pasture does not.\nIt&#39;s easy enough to use a file resource to create your own. This service unit\nfile will tell systemd how and when to start our Pasture application.\nTask 10:\n\nFirst, create a file called pasture.service.\nvim pasture/files/pasture.service\nInclude the following contents:\n[Unit]\nDescription=Run the pasture service\n\n[Service]\nEnvironment=RACK_ENV=production\nExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pasture start\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\nIf you&#39;re not familiar with the format of a systemd unit file, don&#39;t worry\nabout the details here. The beauty of Puppet is that the basic principles you\nlearn with this example will be easily portable to whatever system you work\nwith.\nTask 11:\n\nNow open your init.pp manifest again.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nFirst, add a file resource to manage your service unit file.\nclass pasture {\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;:\n    source =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/systemd/system/pasture.service&#39;:\n    source =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture.service&#39;,\n  }\n\n}\n\nNext, add the service resource itself. This resource will have the title\npasture and a single parameter to set the state of the service to running.\nclass pasture {\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;:\n    source =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/systemd/system/pasture.service&#39;:\n    source =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture.service&#39;,\n  }\n\n  service { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure =&gt; running,\n  }\n\n}\n\nResource ordering\nThere&#39;s one more step before this class is complete. We need a way to ensure\nthat the resources defined in this class are managed in the correct order. The\n&quot;package, file, service&quot; pattern describes the common dependency relationships\namong these resources: we want to install a package, write a configuration\nfile, and start a service, in that order. Furthermore, if we make changes to\nthe configuration file later, we want Puppet to restart our service so it can\npick up those changes.\nThough Puppet code will default to managing resources in the order they&#39;re\nwritten in a manifest, we strongly recommend that you make dependencies among\nresources explicit through relationship\nmetaparameters.\nA metaparameter is a parameter, that affects how Puppet handles a resource\nrather than directly defining its desired state. Relationship metaparameters\ntell Puppet about ordering relationships among your resources.\nFor our class, we&#39;ll use two relationship metaparameters: before and\nnotify. before tells Puppet that the current resource must come before the\ntarget resource. The notify metaparameter is like before, but if the target\nresource is a service, it has the additional effect of restarting the service\nwhenever Puppet modifies the resource with the metaparameter set. This is\nuseful when you need Puppet to restart a service to pick up changes in a\nconfiguration file.\nRelationship metaparameters take a resource\nreference\nas a value. This resource reference points to another resource in your Puppet\ncode. The syntax for a resource reference is the capitalized resource type,\nfollowed by square brackets containing the resource title: Type[&#39;title&#39;]. \nTask 12:\n\nIf your init.pp manifest isn&#39;t already open, go ahead and open it again.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nAdd relationship metaparameters to define the dependencies among your\npackage, file, and service resources. Take a moment to think through\nwhat each of these relationship metaparameters does and why.\nclass pasture {\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n    before   =&gt; File[&#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;],\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;:\n    source  =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/systemd/system/pasture.service&#39;:\n    source  =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture.service&#39;,\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n\n  service { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure =&gt; running,\n  }\n\n}\n\nWhen you&#39;re finished, check your syntax one more time with the puppet parser\ntool.\npuppet parser validate pasture/manifests/init.pp\nThe pasture.puppet.vm node is still classified with this pasture class.\nWhen you return to the node and do another puppet agent run, the master will\npick up these added file and service resources and include them in the catalog\nit returns to the node.\nTask 13:\n\nGo ahead and connect to pasture.puppet.vm.\nssh learning@pasture.puppet.vm\nAnd trigger another Puppet agent run.\nsudo puppet agent -t\nNow that the pasture service is configured and running, disconnect from the\nagent node.\nexit\nFrom the master, use the curl command to retrieve an ASCII elephant from\nport 4567 of the pasture.puppet.vm node.\ncurl &#39;pasture.puppet.vm:4567/api/v1/cowsay?message=Hello!&#39;\nReview\nIn this quest, we got into some of the specifics of writing Puppet code.\nYou used the common &quot;package, file, service&quot; pattern to configure the Pasture\napplication and set up a service unit to run its process on your server.\nYou learned how to make a file available to Puppet by placing it in your\nmodule&#39;s files directory. With that file in place, you learned how to use it\nin a file resource with the source parameter and a URI.\nFinally, we went over resource ordering. You used the before and notify\nmetaparameters to define relationships among the resources in your class to\nensure that Puppet will manage the resources in the correct order and refresh\nthe service when its configuration file is modified.\nIn the next quest, you&#39;ll learn to make this class more flexible by adding\nvariables and replacing your static files with templates.\nAdditional Resources\n\nOur docs page covers resource relationships in more depth, including some alternative syntax forms you might run into reading others’ Puppet code.\nResource relationships are also covered by a lesson in our self-paced course catalog.\n\n"},"quests/variables_and_templates.html":{"url":"quests/variables_and_templates.html","title":"Variables and Templates","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nVariables and templates\nQuest objectives\n\nLearn about variables assignment and use.\nLearn how to create an EPP template.\nUse the hash syntax to pass variables to an EPP template.\n\nGetting started\nIn this quest, we introduce variables and templates. Once you assign a\nvalue to a variable in a Puppet manifest, you can use that variable throughout\nthe manifest to yield the assigned value. Through templates, you can\nincorporate these variables into the content of any files your Puppet\nmanifest manages.\nWhile it&#39;s convenient to introduce variables and templates here as a pair,\nas you work through the rest of this quest guide, you&#39;ll see that variables\nare used along with many of Puppet&#39;s other features to help write adaptable\nPuppet code.\nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, enter the following command:\nquest begin variables_and_templates\nVariables\n\nBeauty is variable, ugliness is constant.\n-Douglas Horton\n\nVariables allow a value to be bound to a name, which can then be used later\nin your manifest.\nA variable name is prefixed with a $ (dollar sign), and a value is assigned\nwith the = operator. Assigning a short string to a variable, for example,\nlooks like this:\n$my_variable = &#39;look, a string!&#39;\n\nOnce you have defined a variable, you can use it anywhere in your manifest where\nyou want to use the assigned value. Note that variables are parse-order\ndependent, which means that a variable must be defined before it can be used.\nTrying to use an undefined variable will result in a special undef value.\nThough this may result in explicit errors, in some cases it will still lead\nto a valid catalog with unexpected contents.\nTechnically, Puppet variables are actually constants from the perspective of\nthe Puppet parser as it parses your Puppet code to create a catalog. Once a\nvariable is assigned, the value is fixed and cannot be changed. The\nvariability, here, refers to the fact that a variable can have a different\nvalue set across different Puppet runs or across different systems in your\ninfrastructure.\nTask 1:\n\nLet&#39;s start by setting up a few variables. We&#39;ll define the default\ncharacter the cowsay application will use, the port we want to service to\nrun on, and path of the configuration file.\nOpen your init.pp manifest.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nAssign these variables at the top of your class. Replace the hard-coded\nreferences to the /etc/pasture_config.yaml configuration filepath with the\nvariable.\nclass pasture {\n\n  $port                = &#39;80&#39;\n  $default_character   = &#39;sheep&#39;\n  $default_message     = &#39;&#39;\n  $pasture_config_file = &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n    before   =&gt; File[$pasture_config_file],\n  }\n  file { $pasture_config_file:\n    source  =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n  file { &#39;/etc/systemd/system/pasture.service&#39;:\n    source =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture.service&#39;,\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n  service { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure    =&gt; running,\n  }\n}\n\nWe haven&#39;t yet done anything with the $pasture_port or $default_character\nvariables. To use these, we need a way to pass them into our configuration\nfile. We&#39;ll also need to pass the $pasture_config_file variable to our\nservice unit file so the service will start our Pasture process with the\nconfiguration file we specify if we change it to something other than the default.\nTemplates\nMany of the tasks involved in system configuration and administration come down\nto managing the content of text files. The most direct way to handle this is\nthrough a templating language. A template is similar to a text file but offers\na syntax for inserting variables as well as some more advanced language\nfeatures like conditionals and iteration. This flexibility lets you manage a\nwide variety of file formats with a single tool.\nThe limitation of templates is that they&#39;re all-or-nothing. The template must\ndefine the entire file you want to manage. If you need to manage only a single\nline or value in a file because another process or Puppet module will manage a\ndifferent part of the file, you may want to investigate\nAugeas,\nconcat, or the\nfile_line resource\ntype.\nEmbedded Puppet templating language\nPuppet supports two templating languages, Embedded Puppet\n(EPP) and\nEmbedded Ruby\n(ERB).\nEPP templates were released in Puppet 4 to provide a Puppet-native templating\nlanguage that would offer several improvements over the ERB templates that had\nbeen inherited from the Ruby world. Because EPP is now the preferred method,\nit&#39;s what we&#39;ll be using in this quest. Once you understand the basics of\ntemplating, however, you can easily use the ERB format by referring to the\ndocumentation.\nAn EPP template is a plain-text document interspersed with tags that allow\nyou to customize the content.\nTask 2:\n\nIt will be easier to explain the syntax with a concrete example, so let&#39;s create\na template to help manage Pasture&#39;s configuration file.\nFirst, you&#39;ll need to create a templates directory in your pasture module.\nmkdir pasture/templates\nNext, create a pasture_config.yaml.epp template file.\nvim pasture/templates/pasture_config.yaml.epp\nBest practice is to begin your EPP template with a parameter tag. This\ndeclares which parameters your template will accept and allows you to set their\ndefault values. A template will work without this tag, but explicitly declaring\nyour variables here makes your template more readable and easier to\nmaintain.\nIt&#39;s also good practice to add a comment to the beginning of the file so\npeople who might come across it know that it&#39;s managed by Puppet and any manual\nchanges they make will be reverted the next time Puppet runs. This comment is\nintended to be included directly in the final file, so remember to use the\ncomment syntax native to the file format you&#39;re working with.\nThe beginning of your template should look like the following. We&#39;ll explain\nthe details of the syntax below.\n&lt;%- | $port,\n      $default_character,\n      $default_message,\n| -%&gt;\n# This file is managed by Puppet. Please do not make manual changes.\nThe bars (|) surrounding the list of parameters are a special syntax that\ndefine the parameters tag. The &lt;% and %&gt; are the opening and closing tag\ndelimiters that distinguish EPP tags from the body of the file. Those hyphens\n(-) next to the tag delimiters will remove indentation and whitespace\nbefore and after the tag. This allows you to put this parameter tag at the\nbeginning of the file, for example, without the newline character after the\ntag creating an empty line at the beginning of the output file.\nNext, we&#39;ll use the variables we set up to define values for the port and\ncharacter configuration options.\n&lt;%- | $port,\n      $default_character,\n      $default_message,\n| -%&gt;\n# This file is managed by Puppet. Please do not make manual changes.\n---\n:default_character: &lt;%= $default_character %&gt;\n:default_message:   &lt;%= $default_message %&gt;\n:sinatra_settings:\n  :port: &lt;%= $port %&gt;\n\nThe &lt;%= ... %&gt; tags we use to insert our variables into the file are called\nexpression-printing tags. These tags insert the content of a Puppet\nexpression, in this case the string values assigned to our variables.\nNow that this template is set up, let&#39;s return to our init.pp manifest\nand see how to use it to define the content of a file resource.\nFirst, save your template file and exit Vim.\nTask 3:\n\nNow open your init.pp manifest.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nThe file resource type has two different parameters that can be used to\ndefine the content of the managed file: source and content.\nAs we discussed earlier, source takes the URI of a source file like the ones\nwe&#39;ve placed in our module&#39;s files directory. The content parameter\ntakes a string as a value and sets the content of the managed file to that\nstring.\nTo set a file&#39;s content with a template, we&#39;ll use Puppet&#39;s built-in epp()\nfunction to parse our EPP template file and use the resulting string as the\nvalue for the content parameter.\nThis epp() function takes two arguments: First, a file reference in the\nformat &#39;&lt;MODULE&gt;/&lt;TEMPLATE_NAME&gt;&#39; that specifies the template file\nto use. Second, a hash of variable names and values to pass to the\ntemplate.\nTo avoid cramming all our variables into the epp() function, we&#39;ll put them\nin a variable called $pasture_config_hash just before the file resource.\nclass pasture {\n\n  $port                = &#39;80&#39;\n  $default_character   = &#39;sheep&#39;\n  $default_message     = &#39;&#39;\n  $pasture_config_file = &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n    before   =&gt; File[$pasture_config_file],\n  }\n  $pasture_config_hash = {\n    &#39;port&#39;              =&gt; $port,\n    &#39;default_character&#39; =&gt; $default_character,\n    &#39;default_message&#39;   =&gt; $default_message,\n  }\n  file { $pasture_config_file:\n    content =&gt; epp(&#39;pasture/pasture_config.yaml.epp&#39;, $pasture_config_hash),\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n  file { &#39;/etc/systemd/system/pasture.service&#39;:\n    source =&gt; &#39;puppet:///modules/pasture/pasture.service&#39;,\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n  service { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure    =&gt; running,\n  }\n}\n\nNow that that&#39;s set, we can repeat the process for the service unit file.\nSave and exit your init.pp file.\nTask 4:\n\nRather than start from scratch, let&#39;s copy the existing file to use as a base\nfor our template.\ncp pasture/files/pasture.service pasture/templates/pasture.service.epp\nNow open the file with Vim to templatize it.\nvim pasture/templates/pasture.service.epp\nAdd your parameters tag and comment to the beginning of the file.

You reworked the\npasture module to replace hard-coded values in your resources and\nconfiguration files with variables.\nWith variables set in your manifest, you saw how to use the hash syntax and\nEPP template function to pass those variables into a template. Within an .epp\ntemplate, we covered the parameter tag, which is used at the beginning of\na template to specify which variables are available within the template, and\nexpression-printing tags, which are used to insert variable values into the\ncontent of your templatized file.\nWe mentioned that variables are an important part of the concepts we&#39;ll\nintroduce in the following quests. In the next quest, you&#39;ll see how to create\na parameterized class, which will allow you to set important variables\nin your class as you declare it. Parameters allow you to customize how a class\nis configured without editing code in the module where the class is defined.\nAdditional Resources\n\nOur docs page has more information on variables and templates.\nThese topics are also covered in more depth in our in-person and online trainings.\n\n"},"quests/class_parameters.html":{"url":"quests/class_parameters.html","title":"Class Parameters","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nClass parameters\nQuest objectives\n\nUnderstand the value of writing configurable classes.\nLearn the syntax for creating a parameterized class.\nLearn how to use the resource-like class declaration syntax to set the\nparameters for a class.\n\nGetting started\nIn the last quest, you used variables to introduce some flexibility to your\npasture module. So far, however, all of the variables are assigned within the\nclass itself.\nA well-written module in Puppet should let you customize all its \nimportant variables without editing the module itself. This is done with\nclass parameters. Writing parameters into a class allows you to declare\nthat class with a set of parameter-value pairs similar to the resource\ndeclaration syntax. This gives you a way to customize all the important\nvariables in your class without making any changes to the module that defines\nit. \nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, enter the following command:\nquest begin class_parameters\nWriting a parameterized class\nA class&#39;s parameters are defined as a comma-separated list of parameter name\nand default value pairs ($parameter_name = default_value,). These parameter\nvalue pairs are enclosed in parentheses ((...)) between the class name and\nthe opening curly bracket ({) that begins the body of the class. For\nreadability, multiple parameters should be listed one per line, for example:\nclass class_name (\n  $parameter_one = default_value_one,\n  $parameter_two = default_value_two,\n){\n ...\n}\n\nNotice that this list of parameters must be comma-separated, while variables\nset within the body of the class itself are not. This is because the Puppet\nparser treats these parameters as a list, while variable assignments in the\nbody of your class are individual statements. These parameters are available as\nvariables within the body of the class.\nTask 1:\n\nTo get started, let&#39;s modify the main pasture class to use class parameters.\nOpen your init.pp manifest.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nYour parameter list will replace the variables assignments you used in the\nprevious quest. By setting the parameter defaults to the same values you had\nassigned to those variables, you can maintain the same default behavior for the\nclass.\nRemove the variables set at the beginning of your class and add a corresponding\nset of parameters. When you&#39;re done, your class should look like the following\nexample.\nclass pasture (\n  $port                = &#39;80&#39;,\n  $default_character   = &#39;sheep&#39;,\n  $default_message     = &#39;&#39;,\n  $pasture_config_file = &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n){\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n    before   =&gt; File[$pasture_config_file],\n  }\n\n  $pasture_config_hash = {\n    &#39;port&#39;              =&gt; $port,\n    &#39;default_character&#39; =&gt; $default_character,\n    &#39;default_message&#39;   =&gt; $default_message,\n  }\n\n  file { $pasture_config_file:\n    content =&gt; epp(&#39;pasture/pasture_config.yaml.epp&#39;, $pasture_config_hash),\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n\n  $pasture_service_hash = {\n    &#39;pasture_config_file&#39; =&gt; $pasture_config_file,\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/systemd/system/pasture.service&#39;:\n    content =&gt; epp(&#39;pasture/pasture.service.epp&#39;, $pasture_service_hash),\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n\n  service { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure    =&gt; running,\n  }\n\n}\n\nWhen you&#39;re done making these changes, save and exit your file. Use the\npuppet parser tool to check your syntax.\npuppet parser validate pasture/manifests/init.pp\nResource-like class declarations\nNow that your class has parameters, let&#39;s see how these parameters are set.\nUntil now, you&#39;ve been using include to declare the class as part of your\nnode classification in the site.pp manifest. This include function declares\na class without explicitly setting any parameters, allowing any parameters in\nthe class to use their default values. Any parameters without defaults take the\nspecial undef value.\nTo declare a class with specific parameters, use the resource-like class\ndeclaration. As the name suggests, the syntax for a resource-like class\ndeclaration is very similar to a resource declaration. It consists of the\nkeyword class followed by a set of curly braces ({...}) containing the\nclass name with a colon (:) and a list of parameters and values. Any values\nleft out in this declaration are set to the defaults defined within the class,\nor undef if no default is set.\nclass { &#39;class_name&#39;:\n  parameter_one =&gt; value_one,\n  parameter_two =&gt; value_two,\n}\n\nUnlike the include function, which can be used for the same class in multiple\nplaces, resource-like class declarations can only be used once per class.\nBecause a class declared with the include uses defaults, it will always be\nparsed into the same set of resources in your catalog. This means that Puppet\ncan safely handle multiple include calls for the same class. Because \nmultiple resource-like class declarations are not guaranteed to lead to the same\nset of resources, Puppet has no unambiguous way to handle multiple\nresource-like declarations of the same class. Attempting to make multiple\nresource-like declarations of the same class will cause the Puppet parser to\nthrow an error.\nThough we won&#39;t go into detail here, you should know that external data-sources\nlike facter and hiera can give you a lot of flexibility in your classes\neven with the include syntax. For now, you should be aware that though the\ninclude function uses defaults, there are ways to make those defaults very\nintelligent.\nTask 2:\n\nNow let&#39;s go ahead and use a resource-like class declaration to customize the\npasture class from the site.pp manifest. Most of the defaults will still\nwork well, but for the sake of this example, let&#39;s set this instance of our\nPasture application to use the classic cow character instead of the sheep we\nhad set as the parameter default.\nOpen your site.pp manifest.\nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp\nAnd modify your node definition for pasture.puppet.vm to include a\nresource-like class declaration. We&#39;ll set the default_character parameter\nto the string &#39;cow&#39;, and leave the other two parameters unset, letting them\ntake their default values.\nnode &#39;pasture.puppet.vm&#39; {\n  class { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    default_character =&gt; &#39;cow&#39;,\n  }\n}\n\nNotice that with your class parameters set up, all the necessary configuration\nfor all the components of the Pasture application can be handled with a single\nresource-like class declaration. The diverse commands and file formats that\nwould ordinarily be involved in managing this application are reduced to this\nsingle set of parameters and values.\nTask 3:\n\nLet&#39;s connect to the pasture.puppet.vm node.\nssh learning@pasture.puppet.vm\nAnd trigger a Puppet agent run to apply this parameterized class.\nsudo puppet agent -t\nWhen the run is complete, return to the master.\nexit\nAnd check that your configuration changes have taken effect.\ncurl &#39;pasture.puppet.vm/api/v1/cowsay?message=Hello!&#39;\nReview\nIn this quest, we introduced class parameters, a way to customize a class\nas it&#39;s declared. These parameters let you set up a single interface for you\nto customize any aspect of the system your Puppet module manages.\nWe also revisited the include function and covered the resource-like class\ndeclaration, the syntax for specifying values for a class&#39;s parameters as they\nare declared.\nIn the next quest, we&#39;ll introduce facts, which can be used to easily\nintroduce data about your agent system into your Puppet code.\nAdditional Resources\n\nCheck out our docs page on classes for more information.\nIf you&#39;re interested in more advanced methods for adding data to your classes, you might want to read about using modules with Hiera.\n\n"},"quests/facts.html":{"url":"quests/facts.html","title":"Facts","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nFacts\nQuest objectives\n\nLearn how to use the facter tool to access system information.\nUse the facts hash to incorporate system information into your Puppet code.\n\nGetting started\nThe class parameters you learned about in the previous quest let you reduce\nmany of the tasks involved in configuring an application (or whatever system\ncomponent your module manages) to a single, well-defined interface. You can\nmake your life even easier by writing a module that will automatically use\navailable system data to set some of its variables.\nIn this quest, we&#39;ll discuss facter. The\nfacter tool allows Puppet to automatically access information about the\nsystem where an agent is running as variables within your Puppet manifest.\nAs you&#39;ll see in this quest, these facts can be quite useful on their own. In\nthe next quest, you will see how they can be used along with conditional\nstatements to let you write Puppet code that will behave differently in\ndifferent contexts.\nTo start this quest enter the following command:\nquest begin facts\nFacter\n\nGet your facts first, then distort them as you please.\n-Mark Twain\n\nYou already encountered the facter tool when we asked you to run facter\nipaddress in the setup section of this Quest Guide. We briefly discussed\nthe tool&#39;s role in a Puppet run: the Puppet agent runs facter to get a list\nof facts about the system to send to the Puppet master as it requests a\ncatalog. The Puppet master then uses these facts to help compile that catalog\nbefore sending it back to the Puppet agent to be applied.\nBefore we get into integrating facts into your Puppet code, let&#39;s use the\nfacter tool from the command line to see what kinds of facts are available\nand how they&#39;re structured.\nTask 1:\n\nFirst, connect to the agent node prepared for this quest.\nssh learning@pasture.puppet.vm\nYou can access a standard set of facts with the facter command. Adding the\n-p flag will include any custom facts that you may have installed on the\nPuppet master and synchronized with the agent during the pluginsync step of a\nPuppet run. We&#39;ll pass this facter -p command to less so you can scroll\nthrough the output in your terminal.\nfacter -p | less\nWhen you&#39;re done, press q to quit less.\nNotice that the output of this command is shown as a hash. Some facts, such as\nos include data in a nested JSON format.\nfacter -p os\nYou can drill down into this structure by using dots (.) to specify the key\nat each child level of the hash, for example:\nfacter -p os.family\nNow that you know how to check what data are available via facter and how the\ndata are structured, let&#39;s return to the Puppet master so you can see how this\ncan be integrated into your Puppet code.\nexit\nAll facts are automatically made available within your manifests. You can\naccess the value of any fact via the $facts hash, following the\n$facts[&#39;fact_name&#39;] syntax. To access structured facts, you can chain more\nnames using the same bracket indexing syntax. For example, the os.family fact\nyou accessed above is available within a manifest as $facts[&#39;os&#39;][&#39;family&#39;].\nLet&#39;s take a break from the Pasture module you&#39;ve been working on. Instead,\nwe&#39;ll create a new module to manage an MOTD (Message of the Day) file. This\nfile is commonly used on *nix systems to display information about a host when\na user connects. Using facts will allow you to create a dynamic MOTD that can\ndisplay some basic information about the system.\nCreating a new module will also help review some of the concepts you&#39;ve learned\nso far.\nTask 2:\n\nFrom your modules directory, create the directory structure for a module\ncalled motd. You&#39;ll need two subdirectories called manifests and\ntemplates.\nmkdir -p motd/{manifests,templates}\nTask 3:\n\nBegin by creating an init.pp manifest to contain the main motd class.\nvim motd/manifests/init.pp\nThis class will consist of a single file resource to manage the /etc/motd\nfile. We&#39;ll use a template to set the value for this resource&#39;s content\nparameter.\nclass motd {\n\n  $motd_hash = {\n    &#39;fqdn&#39;       =&gt; $facts[&#39;networking&#39;][&#39;fqdn&#39;],\n    &#39;os_family&#39;  =&gt; $facts[&#39;os&#39;][&#39;family&#39;],\n    &#39;os_name&#39;    =&gt; $facts[&#39;os&#39;][&#39;name&#39;],\n    &#39;os_release&#39; =&gt; $facts[&#39;os&#39;][&#39;release&#39;][&#39;full&#39;],\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/motd&#39;:\n    content =&gt; epp(&#39;motd/motd.epp&#39;, $motd_hash),\n  }\n\n}\n\nThe $facts hash and top-level (unstructured) facts are automatically loaded\nas variables into any template. To improve readability and reliability, we\nstrongly suggest using the method shown here. Be aware, however, that\nyou will likely encounter templates that refer directly to facts using the\ngeneral variable syntax rather than the $facts hash syntax we suggest here.\nTask 4:\n\nNow create the motd.epp template.\nvim motd/templates/motd.epp\nBegin with a parameters tag to make the set of variables used in the template\nexplicit. Note that the MOTD is a plaintext file without any commenting syntax,\nso we&#39;ll leave out the conventional &quot;managed by Puppet&quot; note.\n&lt;%- | $fqdn,\n      $os_family,\n      $os_name,\n      $os_release,\n| -%&gt;\nNext, add a simple welcome message and use the variables assigned from our fact\nvalues to provide some basic information about the system.\n&lt;%- | $fqdn,\n      $os_family,\n      $os_name,\n      $os_release,\n| -%&gt;\nWelcome to &lt;%= $fqdn %&gt;\n\nThis is a &lt;%= $os_family %&gt; system running &lt;%= $os_name %&gt; &lt;%= $os_release %&gt;\n\nTask 5:\n\nWith this template set, your simple MOTD module is complete. Open your\nsite.pp manifest to assign it to the pasture.puppet.vm node. \nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp\nWe&#39;re not using any parameters, so we&#39;ll use the include function to add the\nmotd class to the pasture.puppet.vm node definition.\nnode &#39;pasture.puppet.vm&#39; {\n  include motd\n  class { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    default_character =&gt; &#39;cow&#39;,\n  }\n}\n\nTask 6:\n\nOnce this is complete, connect again to the pasture.puppet.vm node.\nssh learning@pasture.puppet.vm\nAnd trigger a Puppet agent run.\nsudo puppet agent -t\nTo see the MOTD, first disconnect from pasture.puppet.vm.\nexit\nNow reconnect.\nssh learning@pasture.puppet.vm\nOnce you&#39;ve had a chance to admire the MOTD, return to the Puppet master.\nexit\nReview\nIn this quest, we introduced the facter tool and provided an overview of how\nthis tool can be used to access a structured set of system data.\nWe then showed you how to access facts from within a Puppet manifest and assign\nthe values of these facts to variables. Using data from Facter, you created a\ntemplate to manage a MOTD file.\nIn the next quest, we&#39;ll show you how you can add further flexibility to your\nPuppet code with conditional statements. We&#39;ll give you an example of how\nthese facts can be used in conjunction with these conditional statements to\ncreate intelligent defaults based on system information.\nAdditional Resources\n\nCheck out our docs page for more information on facter and facts in Puppet.\nYou can also find a lesson on Facter in our self-paced training course catalog.\nFacts are covered in-depth in our Getting Started with Puppet and Puppet Practitioner courses. Explore our in-person and online training options for more information.\n\n"},"quests/conditional_statements.html":{"url":"quests/conditional_statements.html","title":"Conditional Statements","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nConditional Statements\nQuest objectives\n\nLearn about the role of conditional statements in writing flexible Puppet code\nLearn the syntax of the if statement.\nUse an if statement to intelligently manage a package dependency.\n\nGetting started\nIn this quest, we&#39;ll discuss conditional statements. Conditional statements let\nyou write Puppet code that will behave differently in different contexts.\nTo start this quest enter the following command:\nquest begin conditional_statements\nWriting for flexibility\n\nThe green reed which bends in the wind is stronger than the mighty oak which\nbreaks in a storm.\n-Confucius\n\nBecause Puppet manages configurations on a variety of systems fulfilling a\nvariety of roles, great Puppet code means flexible and portable Puppet code.\nThough Puppet&#39;s types and providers can translate between Puppet&#39;s resource\nsyntax and the native tools on a wide variety of systems, there are still a lot\nquestions that you as a Puppet module developer will need to answer yourself.\nA good rule of thumb is that the resource abstraction layer answers how\nquestions, while the Puppet code itself answers what questions.\nAs an example, let&#39;s take a look at the puppetlabs-apache module. While this\nmodule&#39;s developers rely on Puppet&#39;s providers to determine how the Apache\npackage is installed—whether it&#39;s handled by yum, apt-get or another\npackage manager—Puppet doesn&#39;t have any way of automatically determining the\nname of the package that needs to be installed. Depending on whether the module\nis used to manage Apache on a RedHat or Debian system, it will need to manage\neither the httpd or apache2 package.\nThis kind of what question is often addressed through a combination of\nconditional statements and facts or parameters.  If you look at the\npuppetlabs-apache module on the Forge, you&#39;ll see this\npackage name and numerous other\nvariables\nset based on an if statement using the osfamily fact. (You may notice that\nthis module uses an un-structured $::osfamily format for this fact to\npreserve backwards compatibility. You can read more about this form of\nreference on the docs\npage)\nSimplified to show only the values we&#39;re concerned with, the conditional\nstatement looks like this:\nif $::osfamily == &#39;RedHat&#39; {\n  ...\n  $apache_name = &#39;httpd&#39;\n  ...\n} elsif $::osfamily == &#39;Debian&#39; {\n  ...\n  $apache_name = &#39;apache2&#39;\n  ...\n}\n\nHere, the $apache_name variable is set to either httpd or apache2\ndepending on the value of the $::osfamily fact. Elsewhere in the module,\nyou&#39;ll find a package\nresource\nthat uses this $apache_name variable to set its name parameter.\npackage { &#39;httpd&#39;:\n  ensure =&gt; $ensure,\n  name   =&gt; $::apache::apache_name,\n  notify =&gt; Class[&#39;Apache::Service&#39;],\n}\n\nRemember that because the name parameter is being explicitly set here, the\nresource title (httpd) only serves as an internal identifier for the\nresource—it doesn&#39;t actually determine the name of the package that will be\ninstalled.\nConditions\n\nJust dropped in (to see what condition my condition was in)\n-Mickey Newbury\n\nNow that you&#39;ve seen this real-world example of how and why a conditional\nstatement can be used to create more flexible Puppet code, let&#39;s take a moment\nto discuss how these statements work and how to write them. \nConditional statements return different values or execute different blocks of\ncode depending on the value of a specified variable.\nPuppet supports a few different ways of implementing conditional logic:\n\nif statements,\nunless statements,\ncase statements, and\nselectors.\n\nBecause the same concept underlies these different forms of conditional logic\navailable in Puppet, we&#39;ll only cover the if statement in the tasks for this\nquest. Once you have a good understanding of how to implement if statements,\nwe&#39;ll leave you with descriptions of the other forms and some notes on when you\nmay find them useful.\nAn if statement includes a condition followed by a block of Puppet code that\nwill only be executed if that condition evaluates as true. Optionally,\nan if statement can also include any number of elsif clauses and an else\nclause.\n\nIf the if condition fails, Puppet moves on to the elsif condition (if one\nexists).\nIf both the if and elsif conditions fail, Puppet will execute the code in\nthe else clause (if one exists).\nIf all the conditions fail, and there is no else block, Puppet will do\nnothing and move on.\n\nPick a server\nLet&#39;s return to our Pasture example module. The application is build on the\nSinatra framework. Out of the box, Sinatra\nsupports a few different options for the server the service will run: WEBrick,\nThin, or Mongrel. In production, you would likely use Sinatra with a more\nrobust option such as Passenger or\nUnicorn, but these built-in options will be\nadequate for this lesson.\nWe can easily select which server will be used in the Pasture application&#39;s\nconfiguration file, However, options other than the default WEBrick are not\nincluded as pre-requisites when we install the Pasture package. To use these\nother options, we&#39;ll need our module to manage them as separate package\nresources.  However, we don&#39;t want to install these extra packages if we don&#39;t\nplan on using them. Using the if statement discussed above, we&#39;ll configure\nthe pasture class to manage the necessary Thin or Mongrel package resource\nonly if one of these servers is selected.\nBy using a class parameter to specify the preferred server for Sinatra to use,\nwe can use the same value to pass on to our configuration file template and to\ndecide which additional packages need to be installed. Using parameters in this\nway helps keep configuration coordinated across all the components of the\nsystem your module is written to manage.\nTask 1:\n\nOpen the module&#39;s init.pp manifest.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nFirst, add a $sinatra_server parameter with a default value of webrick. The\nbeginning of your class should look like the following example:\nclass pasture (\n  $port                = &#39;80&#39;,\n  $default_character   = &#39;sheep&#39;,\n  $default_message     = &#39;&#39;,\n  $pasture_config_file = &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n  $sinatra_server      = &#39;webrick&#39;,\n){\n\nNext add the $sinatra_server variable to the $pasture_config_hash so that\nit can be passed through to the configuration file template.\n  $pasture_config_hash = {\n    &#39;port&#39;              =&gt; $port,\n    &#39;default_character&#39; =&gt; $default_character,\n    &#39;default_message&#39;   =&gt; $default_message,\n    &#39;sinatra_server&#39;    =&gt; $sinatra_server,\n  }\n\nTask 2:\n\nOnce that&#39;s complete, open the pasture_config.yaml.epp template.\nvim pasture/templates/pasture_config.yaml.epp\nAdd the $sinatra_server variable to the params block at the beginning of the\ntemplate. The Pasture application passes any settings under the\n:sinatra_settings: key to Sinatra itself.\n&lt;%- | $port,\n      $default_character,\n      $default_message,\n      $sinatra_server,\n| -%&gt;\n# This file is managed by Puppet. Please do not make manual changes.\n---\n:default_character: &lt;%= $default_character %&gt;\n:default_message:   &lt;%= $default_message %&gt;\n:sinatra_settings:\n  :port:   &lt;%= $port %&gt;\n  :server: &lt;%= $sinatra_server %&gt;\n\nNow that your module is able to manage this setting, add a conditional\nstatement to manage the required packages for the Thin and Mongrel webservers.\nTask 3:\n\nReturn to your init.pp manifest.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nYou can wrap a package resource in an if statement to tell your class to only\nmanage the resource if the $sinatra_server variable is thin or mongrel.\nBoth of these servers are available as gems, so you will use the gem\nprovider for the package.\nFinally, we will add a notify parameter pointing to our service resource.\nThis will ensure that the server package is managed before the service, and\nthat any updates to the package will trigger a restart of the service. Your\nclass should look like the example below, with the conditional statement to\nmanage your server packages included at the end.\nclass pasture (\n  $port                = &#39;80&#39;,\n  $default_character   = &#39;sheep&#39;,\n  $default_message     = &#39;&#39;,\n  $pasture_config_file = &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n  $sinatra_server      = &#39;webrick&#39;,\n){\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n    before   =&gt; File[$pasture_config_file],\n  }\n\n  $pasture_config_hash = {\n    &#39;port&#39;              =&gt; $port,\n    &#39;default_character&#39; =&gt; $default_character,\n    &#39;default_message&#39;   =&gt; $default_message,\n    &#39;sinatra_server&#39;    =&gt; $sinatra_server,\n  }\n\n  file { $pasture_config_file:\n    content =&gt; epp(&#39;pasture/pasture_config.yaml.epp&#39;, $pasture_config_hash),\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n\n  $pasture_service_hash = {\n    &#39;pasture_config_file&#39; =&gt; $pasture_config_file,\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/systemd/system/pasture.service&#39;:\n    content =&gt; epp(&#39;pasture/pasture.service.epp&#39;, $pasture_service_hash),\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n\n  service { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure    =&gt; running,\n  }\n\n  if ($sinatra_server == &#39;thin&#39;) or ($sinatra_server == &#39;mongrel&#39;)  {\n    package { $sinatra_server:\n      provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n      notify   =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n\nWith these changes to your class, you can easily accommodate different servers\nfor different agent nodes in your infrastructure. For example, you may want to\nuse the default WEBrick server on a development system and the Thin server on\nfor production.\nWe created two new systems for this quest: pasture-dev.puppet.vm and\npasture-prod.puppet.vm. For a more complex infrastructure, you would likely\nmanage your development, test, and production segments of your infrastructure\nby creating a distinct environment\nfor each. For now, however, we can easily demonstrate our conditional statement\nby setting up two different node definitions in the site.pp manifest.\nTask 4:\n\nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp\nnode &#39;pasture-dev.puppet.vm&#39; {\n  include pasture\n}\nnode &#39;pasture-prod.puppet.vm&#39; {\n  class { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    sinatra_server =&gt; &#39;thin&#39;,\n  }\n}\n\nThe puppet job tool\nNow that you&#39;re working across multiple nodes, connecting manually with SSH to\ntrigger Puppet runs may start to seem a little tedious. The puppet job tool\nlets you trigger Puppet runs across multiple nodes remotely.\nTask 5:\n\nBefore using this tool, we&#39;ll have to take a few steps via the PE console to set\nup authentication through PE&#39;s role-based access control system (RBAC).\nTo log in to the console, bring up a web browser on the host system you&#39;re\nusing to run the Learning VM and navigate to https://&lt;VM&#39;s IPADDRESS&gt;. (Note\nthat using https will take you to the console, while http will take you to\nthis quest guide.)\nYou may see a warning from your browser that the PE console is using a\nself-signed certificate. You can safely ignore this warning and proceed to the\nPE console login page. (You may have to click on an advanced option for the\noption to proceed.)\nUse the following credentials to log in:\nUsername: adminPassword: puppetlabs\nOnce you&#39;re connected, click the Access control menu option in the\nnavigation bar at near the bottom left of the screen, then select Users\nin the Access Control navigation menu.\nCreate a new user with the Full name Learning and Login learning.\nClick on the name of the new user, then click the Generate password reset\nlink. Copy the given link to a new browser tab and set the password to:\npuppet.\nReturn to the original PE console browser tab, and under the Access Control\nnavigation bar, click the User Roles menu option. Click on the link for the\nOperators role. Select the Learning user from the dropdown menu, click\nthe Add user button, and finally click the Commit 1 change button near\nthe bottom right of the console screen. Close the new browser tab that was\nused to reset the user password.\nWith this user configured, you can use the puppet access command to generate\na token that will allow you to use the puppet job tool. We&#39;ll set the\nlifetime for this token to one day so you won&#39;t have to worry about\nre-authenticating as you work.\npuppet access login --lifetime 1d\nWhen prompted, supply the username learning and password puppet.\nNow you can trigger Puppet agent runs on pasture-dev.puppet.vm and\npasture-prod.puppet.vm with the puppet job tool. We provide the names of\nthe two nodes in a comma-separated list after the --nodes flag. (Note that\nthere is no space between the node names, which can make it a little hard to\ntell the difference between a comma that separates node names and the dots in\nthe node names themselves.)\npuppet job run --nodes pasture-dev.puppet.vm,pasture-prod.puppet.vm\nWhen the jobs complete, take a moment to check each with a curl command.\ncurl &#39;pasture-dev.puppet.vm/api/v1/cowsay?message=Hello!&#39;\nand\ncurl &#39;pasture-prod.puppet.vm/api/v1/cowsay?message=Hello!&#39;\nTo verify that each system is running the server you specified, you can log\nin and use the journalctl command to check the service&#39;s startup log.\nssh learning@pasture-dev.puppet.vm\nAnd run\njournalctl -u pasture\nDisconnect from pasture-dev\nexit\nAnd connect to the next system:\nssh learning@pasture-prod.puppet.vm\nCheck the log here as well:\njournalctl -u pasture\nNow that you&#39;ve verified that each node is running the expected server,\ndisconnect to return to the Learning VM.\nexit\nReview\nIn this quest, you learned how conditional statements can help make the code\nyou write for a Puppet module adaptable to cover different conditions. You saw\nan example of how the puppetlabs-apache module uses a conditional statement\nto install a different package depending on the node&#39;s operating system. After\nlearning about the syntax of the if statement, you incorporated a conditional\nstatement into your pasture module to help manage the package dependencies\nfor the different server options available to the Sinatra framework.\nSo far, the pasture and motd modules you&#39;ve used have been written from\nscratch. This is great for the sake of learning, but one of Puppet&#39;s strengths\nlies in the Puppet community and the Puppet Forge—the repository of pre-written\nmodules you can easily incorporate into your own Puppet codebase. In the next\nquest, you&#39;ll see how to make use of an existing module to set up a database\nbackend for the Pasture application.\nAdditional Resources\n\nPuppet&#39;s docs page covers the syntax of all forms of conditional statements and expressions.\nThe style guide includes best-practices recommendations for the use of conditionals.\n\n"},"quests/the_forge.html":{"url":"quests/the_forge.html","title":"The Forge","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nThe Forge\nQuest objectives\n\nLearn how to access the Puppet Forge and find a module.\nUse class parameters to adapt a Forge module to your needs.\nCreate a wrapper class to integrate a Forge module into your own module.\n\nGetting started\nIn this quest, we&#39;ll introduce you to the Forge, a repository for modules\nwritten and maintained by the Puppet community.\nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, enter the following command:\nquest begin the_forge\nWhat is the Forge?\nThe Puppet Forge is a public repository for Puppet modules.\nThe Forge gives you access to community maintained modules. Using existing\nmodules from the Forge allows you to manage a wide variety of applications and systems\nwithout spending extensive time on custom module development. Furthermore,\nbecause many Forge modules are actively used and maintained by the Puppet\ncommunity, you&#39;ll be working with code that&#39;s already well reviewed and tested.\nThe more other users are involved with a module, the less maintenance and\ntesting burden you and your team will have to take on.\nFor those who put a high premium on vetted code and active maintenance, the\nForge maintains lists of modules that have been checked against standards set\nby Puppet&#39;s Forge team. Modules in the Puppet\nApproved category are audited to ensure\nquality, reliability, and active development. Modules in the Puppet\nSupported list are covered by Puppet\nEnterprise support\ncontracts and are maintained across multiple platforms and versions\nover the course of the Puppet Enterprise release\nlifecycle.\nSo far, you&#39;ve been using the Pasture application&#39;s API to return an ASCII cow\ncharacter with a message in her speech bubble. The application has another\nfeature we haven&#39;t mentioned yet: the ability to store custom messages in a\ndatabase and retrieve them by ID. By default, Pasture uses a simple SQLite\ndatabase to store these messages, but it can be configured to connect to an\nexternal database.\nIn this quest, you&#39;ll use a PostgreSQL module from the Forge to configure a\ndatabase the Pasture application can use to store and retrieve cow messages.\nYour first step will be to find an appropriate module to use. Use the search\ninterface on the Forge website to do a search for\nPostgreSQL.\n(If you don&#39;t currently have internet access, we suggest you still read through\nthe section below to familiarize yourself with the Forge. All the resources\nnecessary to complete the quest are already cached on the VM, so no external\nconnection is necessary to complete the actual installation of the module.)\nThe Forge will show several hits that match your query, including version and\nrelease data information, downloads, a composite rating score, and a supported\nor approved banner where relevant. This information can give you a quick idea\nof which modules in your search results you may want to investigate further.\nFor this quest, we&#39;ll use the puppetlabs/postgresql module. Click on that\nmodule title to see more information and documentation.\nTo set up a database for the Pasture application, you will need to set up a\ndatabase server and create and configure a database instance with the correct\nuser and permissions. We&#39;ll walk you through the specifics below, but take a\nmoment to look through the module&#39;s documentation to see if you can discover\nhow this module can be used to define the desired state for your database\nserver. Can you figure out which class or classes you will use and how their\nparameters should be set?\nInstallation\nRecall that a module is just a directory structure containing Puppet manifests\nand any other code or data needed to manage whatever it is the module helps\nyou manage on a system. The Puppet master finds any modules in its modulepath\ndirectories and uses the module directory structure to find the classes, files,\ntemplates, and whatever else the module provides.\nInstalling a module means placing the module directory into the Puppet master&#39;s\nmodulepath. While you could download the module and manually move it to the\nmodulepath, Puppet provides tools to help manage your modules.\nYou may have noticed two different methods of installation near the top of the\npostgresql module: the Puppetfile and the puppet module tool. For this\nquest, we&#39;ll use the simpler puppet module tool. (As you start managing a\nmore complex Puppet environment and checking your Puppet code into a control\nrepository, however, using a Puppetfile is recommended. You can read more about\nthe Puppetfile and code management workflow\nhere.)\nTask 1:\n\nOn your master, go ahead and use the puppet module tool to install this\nmodule.\npuppet module install puppetlabs-postgresql\nTo confirm that this command placed the module in your modulepath, take a look\nat the contents of your modules directory.\nls /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules\nNotice that when you saw the module on the Forge, it was listed as\npuppetlabs/postgresql, and when you installed it, you called it\npuppetlabs-postgresql, but the actual directory where it installed is\npostgresql. The puppetlabs corresponds to the name of the Forge user\naccount that uploaded the module to the Forge. This distinguishes different\nusers&#39; versions of a module when you&#39;re browsing the Forge and during\ninstallation. When a module is installed, this account name is not\nincluded in the module directory name. If you aren&#39;t aware of this, it could\ncause some confusion; identically named modules will conflict if you try to\ninstall them on the same master.\nTo see a full list of modules installed in all modulepaths on your master, use\nthe puppet module tool&#39;s list subcommand.\npuppet module list\nWriting a wrapper class\nUsing the existing postgresql module, you can add a database component to the\nPasture module without having to reinvent the Puppet code needed to manage\na PostgreSQL server and database instance. Instead, we&#39;ll create what&#39;s called\na wrapper class to declare classes from the postgresql module with\nthe parameters needed by the Pasture application.\nTask 2:\n\nWe&#39;ll call this wrapper class pasture::db and define it in a db.pp manifest\nin the pasture module&#39;s manifests directory.\nvim pasture/manifests/db.pp\nWithin this pasture::db class, we&#39;ll use the classes provided by the\npostgresql module to set up the pasture database that\nwill keep track of our cow sayings.\nclass pasture::db {\n\n  class { &#39;postgresql::server&#39;:\n    listen_addresses =&gt; &#39;*&#39;,\n  }\n\n  postgresql::server::db { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    user     =&gt; &#39;pasture&#39;,\n    password =&gt; postgresql_password(&#39;pasture&#39;, &#39;m00m00&#39;),\n  }\n\n  postgresql::server::pg_hba_rule { &#39;allow pasture app access&#39;:\n    type        =&gt; &#39;host&#39;,\n    database    =&gt; &#39;pasture&#39;,\n    user        =&gt; &#39;pasture&#39;,\n    address     =&gt; &#39;172.18.0.2/24&#39;,\n    auth_method =&gt; &#39;password&#39;,\n  }\n\n}\n\nWith this wrapper class done, you can easily add the database server it defines\nto a node definition in your site.pp manifest. In this case, we&#39;ve kept\nthings simple and created a class without parameters. As needed, you might add\nparameters to this wrapper class in order to pass values through to the\npostgresql classes it contains.\nTask 3:\n\nGo ahead and open your site.pp manifest.\nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp\nCreate a node definition to classify the pasture-db.puppet.vm node with\nthe pasture::db class.\nnode &#39;pasture-db.puppet.vm&#39; {\n  include pasture::db\n}\n\nUse the puppet job tool to trigger a Puppet agent run on this\npasture-db.puppet.vm node.\npuppet job run --nodes pasture-db.puppet.vm\nNow that this database server is set up, let&#39;s add a parameter to our main\npasture class to specify a database URI and pass this through to the\nconfiguration file.\nTask 4:\n\nOpen your module&#39;s init.pp manifest.\nvim pasture/manifests/init.pp\nAdd a $db parameter with a default value of &#39;none&#39;. You&#39;ll see why we use\n&#39;none&#39; a little later. Add this $db variable to the $pasture_config_hash\nso it will be passed through to the template that defines the application&#39;s\nconfiguration file. When you&#39;ve made these two additions, your class should\nlook like the example below.\nclass pasture (\n  $port                = &#39;80&#39;,\n  $default_character   = &#39;sheep&#39;,\n  $default_message     = &#39;&#39;,\n  $pasture_config_file = &#39;/etc/pasture_config.yaml&#39;,\n  $sinatra_server      = &#39;webrick&#39;,\n  $db                  = &#39;none&#39;,\n){\n\n  package { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure   =&gt; present,\n    provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n    before   =&gt; File[$pasture_config_file],\n  }\n\n  $pasture_config_hash = {\n    &#39;port&#39;              =&gt; $port,\n    &#39;default_character&#39; =&gt; $default_character,\n    &#39;default_message&#39;   =&gt; $default_message,\n    &#39;sinatra_server&#39;    =&gt; $sinatra_server,\n    &#39;db&#39;                =&gt; $db,\n  }\n\n  file { $pasture_config_file:\n    content =&gt; epp(&#39;pasture/pasture_config.yaml.epp&#39;, $pasture_config_hash),\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n\n  $pasture_service_hash = {\n    &#39;pasture_config_file&#39; =&gt; $pasture_config_file,\n  }\n\n  file { &#39;/etc/systemd/system/pasture.service&#39;:\n    content =&gt; epp(&#39;pasture/pasture.service.epp&#39;, $pasture_service_hash),\n    notify  =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n  }\n\n  service { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    ensure    =&gt; running,\n  }\n\n  if ($sinatra_server == &#39;thin&#39;) or ($sinatra_server == &#39;mongrel&#39;)  {\n    package { $sinatra_server:\n      provider =&gt; &#39;gem&#39;,\n      notify   =&gt; Service[&#39;pasture&#39;],\n    }\n  }\n\n}\n\nTask 5:\n\nNext, edit the pasture_config.yaml.epp template. We&#39;ll use a conditional\nstatement to only include the :db: setting if there is a value other than\nnone set for the $db variable.\nvim pasture/templates/pasture_config.yaml.epp\n&lt;%- | $port,\n      $default_character,\n      $default_message,\n      $sinatra_server,\n      $db,\n| -%&gt;\n# This file is managed by Puppet.

We began by covering the Forge website\nand its search features that help you find the right module for your project.\nAfter finding a good module, you used the puppet module tool to install it\ninto your modules directory. With the module installed, you created a\npasture::db class to define the specific database functionality you needed\nfor the Pasture application, and updated the main pasture class to define\nthe URI needed to connect to the database.\nWith this new pasture::db class set up and the db parameter added to the\nmain pasture class, a few changes to your site.pp classification let you\ncreate a database server and connect it to your application server.\nAdditional Resources\n\nWatch this short video for a basic introduction to the Forge.\nFor more in-depth information on the Forge, check our Introduction to the Forge self-paced course.\nOur Getting Started with Puppet course focuses on using Forge modules to quickly get started managing your infrastructure with Puppet.\n\n"},"quests/roles_and_profiles.html":{"url":"quests/roles_and_profiles.html","title":"Roles and Profiles","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nRoles and profiles\nQuest objectives\n\nUnderstand the roles and profiles pattern.\nCreate profile classes that wrap component classes and set parameters\nspecific to your site infrastructure.\nCreate role classes to define the full configuration for a system through\na combination of profile classes.\nLearn how to use regular expressions to create more flexible node\ndefinitions.\n\nGetting started\nIn the last quest, we shifted from managing the Pasture application on a single\nsystem to distributing its components across the pasture-app.puppet.vm and\npasture-db.puppet.vm hosts. The application server and database server you\nconfigured each play a different role in your infrastructure and have a\ndifferent classification in Puppet.\nAs your Puppetized infrastructure grows in scale and complexity, you&#39;ll need to\nmanage more and more kinds of systems. Defining all the classes and parameters\nfor these systems directly in your site.pp manifest doesn&#39;t scale well. The\nroles and profiles pattern gives you a consistent and modular way to define\nhow the components provided in your Puppet modules come together to define each\ndifferent kind of system you need to manage.\nThe concepts introduced in this quest mark an important transition in your\nprogress from learning Puppet basics to understanding how to build these out\ninto the higher level abstractions suitable for managing production\ninfrastructure. This also means a shift in focus from the well-defined\naspects of Puppet tools and syntax to more open-ended questions about what you\nshould do with them.\nThe roles and profiles pattern given in this quest has been successfully\nadopted by some of Puppet&#39;s largest customers and is used internally to manage\nour own infrastructure. It is an example of how higher-level abstractions in\nyour Puppet code can greatly simplify the task of managing configuration across\na great number and variety of systems while maintaining a concise and\nexpressive base of Puppet code. You may find that this kind of abstraction\ncan be better achieved for your particular needs by modifying or abandoning the\nroles and profiles pattern. Even if this is your ultimate conclusion, however,\nyou divergences should be well reasoned and based on strong understanding of\nthe high-level abstraction that the roles and profiles pattern provides.\nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, enter the following command:\nquest begin roles_and_profiles\nWhat are roles and profiles?\nThe roles and profiles pattern we cover in this quest isn&#39;t a new tool or\nfeature in the Puppet ecosystem. Rather, it&#39;s a way of using the tools we&#39;ve\nalready introduced to create something you can maintain and expand as your\nPuppetized infrastructure evolves.\nThe explanation of roles and profiles begins with what we call component\nmodules. Component modules—like your Pasture module and the PostgreSQL module\nyou downloaded from the Forge—are designed to configure a specific piece of\ntechnology on a system. The classes these modules provide are written to be\nflexible. Their parameters provide an API you can use to specify precisely how\nyou need the component technology to be configured.\nThe roles and profiles pattern gives you a consistent way to organize these\ncomponent modules according to the specific applications in your\ninfrastructure.\nA profile is a class that declares one or more related component\nmodules and sets their parameters as needed. The set of profiles on a system\ndefines and configures the technology stack it needs to fulfill its\nbusiness role.\nA role is a class that combines one or more profiles to define the desired\nstate for a whole system. A role should correspond to the business purpose of a\nserver. If your CTO asks what a system is for, the role should fit that\nhigh-level answer: something like &quot;a database server for the Pasture\napplication.&quot; A role itself should only compose profiles and set their\nparameters—it should not have any parameters itself.\nWriting profiles\nUsing roles and profiles is a design pattern, not something written into the\nPuppet source code. As far as the Puppet parser is concerned, the classes that\ndefine your roles and profiles are no different than any other class.\nTask 1:\n\nTo get started setting up your profiles, create a new profile module\ndirectory in your modulepath:\nmkdir -p profile/manifests\nWe&#39;ll begin by creating a pair of profiles related to the Pasture application.\nThe profile for the application server will use a conditional statement to\nmanage two different configurations: a &#39;large&#39; deployment that connects to an\nexternal database, and a &#39;small&#39; deployment that only provides the basic\n&#39;cowsay&#39; endpoint. A second profile will manage the PostgreSQL database that\nbacks the &#39;large&#39; instance of the app server.\nTo make it clear that all of these profiles relate to the Pasture application,\nwe&#39;ll place them in a pasture subdirectory within profile/manifests.\nCreate that subdirectory.\nmkdir profile/manifests/pasture\nTask 2:\n\nNext, create a profile for the Pasture application.\nvim profile/manifests/pasture/app.pp\nHere, you&#39;ll define the profile::pasture::app class.\nThe quest tool created a pasture-app-small.puppet.vm and\npasture-app-large.puppet.vm node for this quest, so we can determine the\nappropriate profile based on the node name. We&#39;ll use a conditional statement\nto set the $default_character and $db parameters based on whether the\nnode&#39;s fqdn fact contains the string &#39;large&#39; or &#39;small&#39;. We&#39;ll also add an\nelse block to fail with an appropriate error message if the fqdn variable\ndoesn&#39;t match &#39;small&#39; or &#39;large&#39;.\nclass profile::pasture::app {\n  if $facts[&#39;fqdn&#39;] =~ &#39;large&#39; {\n    $default_character = &#39;elephant&#39;\n    $db                = &#39;postgres://pasture:m00m00@pasture-db.puppet.vm/pasture&#39;\n  } elsif $facts[&#39;fqdn&#39;] =~ &#39;small&#39; {\n    $default_character = &#39;cow&#39;\n    $db                = &#39;none&#39;\n  } else {\n    fail(&quot;The ${facts[&#39;fqdn&#39;]} node name must match &#39;large&#39; or &#39;small&#39;.&quot;)\n  }\n  class { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    default_message   =&gt; &#39;Hello Puppet!&#39;,\n    sinatra_server    =&gt; &#39;thin&#39;,\n    default_character =&gt; $default_character,\n    db                =&gt; $db,\n  }\n}\n\nTask 3:\n\nNext, create a profile for the Pasture database using the pasture::db\ncomponent class.\nvim profile/manifests/pasture/db.pp\nYou don&#39;t need to customize any parameters here, so you can use the include\nsyntax to declare the pasture::db class.\nclass profile::pasture::db {\n  include pasture::db\n}\n\nWhile these profiles define the configuration of components directly related to\nthe Pasture application, you&#39;ll typically need to manage aspects of these\nsystems that aren&#39;t directly related to their business role. A profile module\nmay include profile classes to manage things like user accounts, DHCP\nconfiguration, firewall rules, and NTP. Because these classes are applied\nacross many or all of the systems in your infrastructure, the convention is to\nkeep them in a base subdirectory. To give an example of a base profile, we&#39;ll\ncreate a profile::base::motd profile class to wrap the motd component class\nyou created earlier.\nTask 4:\n\nCreate a base subdirectory in your profile module&#39;s manifests directory.\nmkdir profile/manifests/base\nNext, create a manifest to define your profile::base::motd profile.\nvim profile/manifests/base/motd.pp\nLike the profile::pasture::db profile class, the profile::base::motd class\nis a wrapper class with an include statement for the motd class.\nclass profile::base::motd {\n  include motd\n}\n\nWriting these wrapper classes may initially seem like unnecessary complexity,\nespecially in the case of simple component classes like motd and\npasture::db. The value of consistency, however, outweighs the effort\nof creating these wrapper classes.\nA profile class is the single source of truth for how a component\nis configured in your site infrastructure. If you ever decide to add\nparameters to your MOTD module, for example, you can easily set those parameters\nin a single profile class and see the changes take effect across any nodes\nwhose role includes that profile. If you had set parameters specifically on\na role or node level, on the other hand, any changes would have to be\nduplicated across every system.\nNow you have a few profiles available. Each of these profiles defines how a\ncomponent on a system should be configured. The next step is to combine them\ninto roles.\nWriting roles\nA role combines profiles to define the full set of components you want Puppet\nto manage on a system. A role should consist of only include statements to\npull in the list of profile classes that make up the role. A role should not\ndirectly declare non-profile classes or individual resources.\nA role&#39;s name should be a simple description of the business purpose of the\nsystem it describes. Specific implementation details related to the technology\nstack are left to the profiles. For example, role::myapp_webserver and\nrole::myapp_database are appropriate names for role classes, while\nrole::postgres_db or role::apache_server are not.\nTask 5:\n\nIn this case, we need two roles to define the systems involved in the Pasture\napplication: role::pasture_app and role::pasture_db. First, create\nthe directory structure for your role module:\nmkdir -p role/manifests\nCreate a manifest to define your role::pasture_app role.\nvim role/manifests/pasture_app.pp\nclass role::pasture_app {\n  include profile::pasture::app\n  include profile::base::motd\n}\n\nNext, create a role for your database server.\nvim role/manifests/pasture_db.pp\nclass role::pasture_db {\n  include profile::pasture::db\n  include profile::base::motd\n}\n\nClassification\nWith your roles clearly defined, classification is very simple. Each node in\nyour infrastructure can be classified with a single role class.\nWe can make use of another feature of Puppet&#39;s node definition syntax to make\nour classification model even more concise. So far, you&#39;ve used simple strings\nas titles for the node definition blocks in your site.pp manifest. Instead of\na string, you can use a regular expression\nas a node definition&#39;s title. This lets you apply the node definition to any\nnode whose title matches the pattern the regular expression specifies.\nWe&#39;ll use the following regular expression to match the two nodes we want to\nclassify as Pasture application servers: /^pasture-app/. The / characters\nhere are delimiters that indicate that we&#39;re using a regular expression rather\nthan an ordinary string. The ^ character marks the beginning of the string.\nThe rest of the characters are the ones we want to match in our node name.\nIf you would like to learn more about regular expressions, you can use\nrubular.com as a quick reference and testing tool. You\nmight test the regular expression given above against your node names to\nvalidate the match. You can also refer to\nregular-expressions.info for a more\nin-depth guide on regular expressions. Generally, the kinds of regular expressions\nneeded for node definitions are quite simple.\nBe aware that there are some special characters in regular expressions that you\nwill need to escape if you want to use them as literal characters to match in\nyour node name. For example, the dot (.) is a special character that will\nmatch any single character. If you want to match a name that includes a dot or\nany other special character, you will need to escape it with a backslash\n(\\.). If the regular expressions in your node definitions start getting\noverly complex, it may be a sign that you need to revisit your node naming\nscheme or look into an alternate classification method such as the PE console\nnode\nclassifier or\nan external node\nclassifier.\nTask 6:\n\nTo get started creating your node definitions, open your site.pp manifest:\nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp\nCreate a node definition blocks for your application and database nodes.\nRemember, a node definition block can take a regular expression as its title.\nYou want any node whose host name begins with pasture-app to be classified\nwith the role::pasture_app role, so create a node definition block with the\ntitle /^pasture-app/ and include the role::pasture_app role for matching\nnodes. Similarly, any node whose name matches pasture-db should be classified\nwith the role::pasture_db role, so add a node definition with the title\n/^pasture-db/ that includes this role.\nNow that you&#39;ve implemented the roles and profiles pattern, remove the previous\nnode definitions for the pasture-app.puppet.vm and pasture-db.puppet.vm\nnodes.\nWhen you&#39;re done, the section of your site.pp after the initial comments\nshould look like the following.\nnode default {\n  # This is where you can declare classes for all nodes.\n  # Example:\n  #   class { &#39;my_class&#39;: }\n}\n\nnode /^pasture-app/ {\n  include role::pasture_app\n}\n\nnode /^pasture-db/ {\n  include role::pasture_db\n}\n\nTask 7:\n\nUse the puppet job tool to trigger a Puppet agent run on the\npasture-db.puppet.vm node. (If your access token has expired, run\npuppet access login learning --lifetime 1d and supply the password puppet\nto generate a new token.)\npuppet job run --nodes pasture-db.puppet.vm\nWhen this run is complete, trigger runs on your two application server nodes.\npuppet job run --nodes pasture-app-small.puppet.vm,pasture-app-large.puppet.vm\nOnce these Puppet runs have completed, you can use the curl command to test\nthe functionality of your application on the two different servers.\ncurl &#39;pasture-app-small.puppet.vm/api/v1/cowsay?message=&quot;hello&quot;&#39;\ncurl &#39;pasture-app-large.puppet.vm/api/v1/cowsay?message=&quot;HELLO!&quot;&#39;\nNote that the database functionality we introduced in the previous quest will\nwork on the &#39;large&#39; instance of our application. The &#39;small&#39; instance\nwill return a 501 error:\ncurl &#39;pasture-app-small.puppet.vm/api/v1/cowsay/sayings&#39;\nReview\nIn this quest, we introduce the roles and profiles pattern, a way to organize\nthe functionality provided by your component modules according to the role of\neach system in your infrastructure.\nYou created profile classes to wrap your component modules and specify their\nparameters, then brought these profile classes together into roles.\nFinally, you used regular expressions in your site.pp manifest to create\nflexible node definitions that assign the correct role to each system in your\ninfrastructure.\nAdditional Resources\n\nRead more about Roles and Profiles at our docs page\nHave a look at the blog post that helped establish the Roles and Profiles pattern as a recommended Puppet workflow.\nLearn more about Roles and Profiles in our self-paced course\nRoles and Profiles are covered in our Getting Started with Puppet and Puppet Practitioner courses.

Implementing Hiera in your Puppet\ninfrastructure allows you to separate site-specific data from your Puppet code\nbase. Hiera lookups in your Puppet code can then be used to intelligently set\nvariables according to the specific details of each node where that code is\napplied.\nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, type the following command:\nquest begin hiera\nWhat is Hiera?\nAll of the methods for managing data you&#39;ve encountered so far in this guide,\nfrom variables and templates to the roles and profiles pattern, get you closer\nto a clean separation of data from code.\nHiera is Puppet&#39;s\nbuilt-in data lookup system. It lets you complete this separation by moving\ndata out of your Puppet manifests and into a separate data source.\nHiera takes its name from the fact that it allows you to organize your data\nhierarchically. Most Hiera implementations begin with common data to set\ndefault values across your whole infrastructure and end with node-specific data\nneeded to configure a unique system. Any data specified on the more specific\nlevel overrides the default set on the more general level. Between these\nmost-general and most-specific levels, Hiera allows you to specify any number\nof intermediate levels.\nThough we haven&#39;t addressed the topic in this guide, implementing custom and\nexternal facts gives\nyou great leeway in setting up your Hiera hierarchies. For example, you might\ninclude a Hiera level corresponding to a country to specify default locale\nconfiguration for a set of workstations or a level corresponding to datacenter\nto help manage network configurations.\nLike Puppet itself, Hiera is a flexible tool that can be configured and used in\na great variety of ways. The goal of this quest is not to cover the full range\nof Hiera&#39;s features or possible implementations, but to offer a simple pattern\nthat many Puppet users have used successfully in both large and small-scale\ndeployments.\nBefore diving into the implementation, let&#39;s take a moment to plan out our\ngoals for this quest.\nWhen you started this quest, the quest tool created four new nodes:\n1. `pasture-app.beauvine.vm`\n2. `pasture-db.auroch.vm`\n3. `pasture-app.auroch.vm`\n4. `pasture-app-dragon.auroch.vm`\nIn previous quests, you used a conditional statement in your\nprofile::pasture::app class to distinguish between nodes with the words\nlarge and small in their host names and decide which would be connected to\nyour database node.\nFor this quest, we&#39;ll make a similar distinction, but handle it a little\ndifferently. Let&#39;s imagine that you&#39;ve set up a tiered pricing structure for\nyour Cowsay as a Service application. Your basic tier offers only basic cowsay\nAPI features, while your your premium level customers get the added database\nfeatures. The hot new startup Beauvine is paying for the basic service, while\ntheir competitor, the more established Auroch has opted for your premium\nservice. Auroch also insists that you set up also set up a custom one-off\ninstance of the application using cowsay&#39;s dragon character as the default.\nYour goal is to create a Hiera configuration that will provide parameter\nvalues to configure your Pasture application servers at the global, per-domain,\nand per-node levels.\nTask 1:\n\nThe first step in implementing Hiera is to add a hiera.yaml configuration\nfile to your environment&#39;s code directory. This configuration file defines the\nlevels in your hierarchy and tells Hiera where to find the data source that\ncorresponds to each level.\nFirst, make sure you&#39;re working in the production environment&#39;s code\ndirectory:\ncd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production\nStart work on a new hiera.yaml file.\nvim hiera.yaml\nIf there is an existing hiera.yaml file present, delete the content found in\nit and replace it with the content below.\nWe&#39;ll implement a simple hierarchy with three levels: &quot;Common data&quot; to set up\nenvironment defaults, &quot;Per-Domain defaults&quot; to define domain-specific defaults,\nand &quot;Per-node data&quot; to define specific data values for individual nodes.\n---\nversion: 5\n\ndefaults:\n  datadir: data\n  data_hash: yaml_data\n\nhierarchy:\n  - name: &quot;Per-node data&quot;\n    path: &quot;nodes/%{trusted.certname}.yaml&quot;\n\n  - name: &quot;Per-domain data&quot;\n    path: &quot;domain/%{facts.networking.domain}.yaml&quot; \n\n  - name: &quot;Common data&quot;\n    path: &quot;common.yaml&quot;\n\nWhen Puppet uses Hiera to look for a value, it searches according to the order\nof levels listed under this configuration file&#39;s hierarchy: section. If\na value is found in a data source defined for the &quot;Per-node data&quot; level, that\nvalue is used. If no matching value is found there, Hiera tries the next level:\nin this case, &quot;Per-domain defaults&quot;. Finally, if no value is found in the previous\ndata sources, Hiera looks in the &quot;Common data&quot; level&#39;s common.yaml file.\nBecause this configuration file is written in\nYAML, not Puppet code you cannot use the\npuppet parser validate command to check your syntax. Instead use the\nfollowing Ruby one-liner from the command line to check your YAML syntax. Keep\nin mind that like puppet parser, this will only verify that your file can be\nparsed, not guarantee that the content is correct.\nruby -e &quot;require &#39;yaml&#39;;require &#39;pp&#39;;pp YAML.load_file(&#39;./hiera.yaml&#39;)&quot;\nExpect to see the following output:\n{&quot;version&quot;=&gt;5,\n &quot;defaults&quot;=&gt;{&quot;datadir&quot;=&gt;&quot;data&quot;, &quot;data_hash&quot;=&gt;&quot;yaml_data&quot;},\n &quot;hierarchy&quot;=&gt;\n  [{&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Per-node data&quot;, &quot;path&quot;=&gt;&quot;nodes/%{trusted.certname}.yaml&quot;},\n   {&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Per-domain data&quot;,\n    &quot;path&quot;=&gt;&quot;domain/%{facts.networking.domain}.yaml&quot;},\n   {&quot;name&quot;=&gt;&quot;Common data&quot;, &quot;path&quot;=&gt;&quot;common.yaml&quot;}]}\n\nTask 2:\n\nBefore setting up your data sources for these levels, let&#39;s add our Hiera\nlookups to the profile::pasture::app class. By doing this first, we&#39;ll know\nwhich values the data sources need to define.\nvim modules/profile/manifests/pasture/app.pp\nHere, use the built-in Hiera lookup() function to tell Puppet to fetch data\nfor each of the pasture component class parameters you want to manage.\nReplace the content of your class with the content that is shown below.\nclass profile::pasture::app {\n  class { &#39;pasture&#39;:\n    default_message   =&gt; lookup(&#39;profile::pasture::app::default_message&#39;),\n    sinatra_server    =&gt; lookup(&#39;profile::pasture::app::sinatra_server&#39;),\n    default_character =&gt; lookup(&#39;profile::pasture::app::default_character&#39;),\n    db                =&gt; lookup(&#39;profile::pasture::app::db&#39;),\n  }\n}\n\nNote that these lookup keys include a fully qualified scope. Though Hiera\nitself doesn&#39;t require this naming pattern for these keys, this pattern allows\nanyone looking at a key in a data source to know exactly how and where it\nis used in Puppet code.\n(Hiera also has an implicit data binding feature which makes direct use of\nfully qualified keys to set class parameters without an explicit lookup.\nBecause this feature can make the relationship between Puppet code and Hiera\ndata less clear, however, the lookup() function is preferred, especially when\nmembers of your team are less familiar with Hiera.)\nNow that you&#39;ve added lookup functions to your profile, it&#39;s time to define\nthese data in your Hiera data sources.\nHiera is very flexible in the kinds of data sources it can use. The two most\ncommon plain-text formats for Hiera data sources are YAML and JSON, but it can\nbe configured to use anything (such as a database or even a custom script) that\ncan take a key as input and return a corresponding value.\nThough this flexibility may tempt you to implement a creative solution, it&#39;s\nbest to use the simplest data source that meets your needs. For that reason,\nwe&#39;ll use YAML files for all the data sources in this quest.\nTask 3:\n\nCreate a data directory with domain and nodes subdirectories.\nmkdir -p data/{domain,nodes}\nTask 4:\n\nBegin with your common.yaml data source, which is kept directly under the\ndata directory.\nvim data/common.yaml\nHere, set common defaults to be used when no value is set in a higher level.\n---\nprofile::pasture::app::default_message: &quot;Baa&quot;\nprofile::pasture::app::sinatra_server: &quot;thin&quot;\nprofile::pasture::app::default_character: &quot;sheep&quot;\nprofile::pasture::app::db: &quot;none&quot;\n\nTask 5:\n\nNext, create the data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml data source to define defaults\nfor the beauvine.vm domain name. Note that because the domain level is above\nthe common level in your hierarchy, the values set here take precedence over\nthose set in common, while the values left undefined default to those set in\ncommon.\nvim data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml\n---\nprofile::pasture::app::default_message: &quot;Welcome to Beauvine!&quot;\n\nTask 6:\n\nNext, create the data/domain/auroch.vm.yaml data source.\nvim data/domain/auroch.vm.yaml\n---\nprofile::pasture::app::default_message: &quot;Welcome to Auroch!&quot;\nprofile::pasture::app::db: &quot;postgres://pasture:m00m00@pasture-db.auroch.vm/pasture&quot;\n\nTask 7:\n\nNow that the data sources for the domain level are complete, move on to the\nnode level.\nvim data/nodes/pasture-app-dragon.auroch.vm.yaml\nHere, just set the default_character to dragon.\n---\nprofile::pasture::app::default_character: &#39;dragon&#39;\n\nYour data directory should now look like the following:\n[/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production]\nroot@learning: # tree data\ndata\n├── common.yaml\n├── domain\n│   ├── auroch.vm.yaml\n│   └── beauvine.vm.yaml\n└── nodes\n    └── pasture-app-dragon.auroch.vm.yaml\n\n2 directories, 4 files\nTask 8:\n\nNext you will use the puppet job tool to trigger a puppet agent run on each\nof these nodes.  Remember, the Learning VM is running both your PE master and\nthe containerized agent nodes themselves, both with a memory allocation below\nrecommended minimums. This means you need to be a gentle when triggering\nconcurrent Puppet agent runs. Use the --concurrency 2 flag to restrict the\nnumber of concurrent agent runs to 2.\npuppet job run --nodes pasture-db.auroch.vm,pasture-app-dragon.auroch.vm,pasture-app.auroch.vm,pasture-app.beauvine.vm --concurrency 2\nNow test out some of the API endpoints for these nodes to see what happens.\nBefore entering each of the following commands, see if you can guess what the\nresult will be!\ncurl pasture-app-dragon.auroch.vm/api/v1/cowsay/sayings\n\ncurl -X POST &#39;pasture-app-dragon.auroch.vm/api/v1/cowsay/sayings?message=Hello!&#39;\n\ncurl pasture-app-dragon.auroch.vm/api/v1/cowsay/sayings/1\n\ncurl pasture-app.auroch.vm/api/v1/cowsay/sayings/1\n\ncurl pasture-app.beauvine.vm/api/v1/cowsay\nReview\nIn this quest, we introduced Hiera, a data abstraction tool that lets you\nseparate data from your Puppet code.\nYou learned about Hiera&#39;s hierarchical model. Hiera lookups start from the\ndata source assigned to the most specific level of your Hierarchy—in this case,\nthe node level. If a value is found at this first level, it is returned and the\nlookup is complete. If no value is found, Hiera will continue checking each\nhigher level of the Hierarchy until it returns a value or determines that no\nvalue has been set.\nYou used the hiera.yaml configuration file to set up a hierarchy of data\nsources. You set environment defaults in a common.yaml file, a middle level\nof per-domain defaults for the beauvine.vm and auroch.vm domains, and\nfinally node-specific data for the pasture-app-dragon.auroch.vm node.\nYou learned how to use the lookup function to retrieve values from these\ndata sources to be used in your Puppet manifests. Using this lookup function,\nyou set parameters for the pasture class based on Hiera data.\nAdditional Resources\n\nRead the Puppet docs on Hiera.\nCheck out an interactive Hiera demo\nto explore how different lookups are resolved for different Hiera hierarchy\nconfigurations.\nYou can find a review of some of the changes introduced in Hiera 5 (the\nversion discussed in this quest) in this blog post.\nHiera is discussed in several of our online and in-person based courses\nand covered in a self-paced training module.\n\n"},"quests/defined_resource_types.html":{"url":"quests/defined_resource_types.html","title":"Defined Resource Types","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nDefined resource types\nQuest objectives\n\nManage a group of resources with a defined resource type.\nUnderstand the difference between a defined resource type and class.\nLearn how to handle the uniqueness constraints of resources contained within\na defined resource type.\nUse a defined resource type to manage user accounts and SSH keys.\n\nGetting started\nAs we noted in discussions of classes earlier in this guide, Puppet&#39;s classes\nare singleton. In other words, classes in the Puppet language can only exist\nonce within a given catalog, and writing Puppet code that declares a class\ntwice will result in a compilation error. For many system components, there is\na natural fit between this idea of a singleton class and a single instance or\ninstallation of the class&#39;s managed component on the node. For example, an\nApache server will generally run only a single instance of an httpd service\nand have one set of configuration files. In this case, Puppet&#39;s singleton\nclasses ensure that you don&#39;t have multiple conflicting specifications for how\na corresponding component should be configured.\nIn some cases, however, this one-to-one correspondence doesn&#39;t hold. A single\nApache httpd process may serve multiple virtual hosts, for example. In this\nquest, we&#39;ll focus on a simple example: user accounts. While Puppet has a\nbuilt-in user resource type, a system administrator will often need to manage\na whole range of other resources on a per-user basis. For this quest, we&#39;ll go\nthrough the exercise of setting up SSH keys for each user account, but the same\nprinciple can easily be extended to cover a range of other user-related\nresources.\nTo address this need, of repeatable groups of resources, the Puppet language\nuses defined resource types. A defined resource type is a block of Puppet\ncode similar in syntax to a class. Like a class, a defined resource type can\ntake parameters and use these parameters to configure a related group of\nresources. Unlike a class, however, a defined resource type, is not singleton.\nThis means that the defined resource type may be declared multiple times on the\nsame node.\nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, type the following command:\nquest begin defined_resource_types\nDefined resource types\n\nRepetition - that is the actuality and the earnestness of existence.\n-Søren Kierkegaard\n\nA defined resource\ntype is a block\nof Puppet code that can be evaluated multiple times within a single node&#39;s\ncatalog.\nThe syntax to create a defined resource type is very similar to the syntax you\nwould use to define a class. Rather than using the class keyword, however,\nyou use define to begin the code block.\ndefine defined_type_name (\n  parameter_one = default_value,\n  parameter_two = default_value,\n){\n  ...\n}\n\nOnce it&#39;s defined, you can use a defined resource type by declaring it like\nyou would any other resource type.\ndefined_type_name { &#39;title&#39;:\n  parameter_one =&gt; &#39;foo&#39;,\n  parameter_two =&gt; &#39;bar&#39;,\n}\n\nBecause a defined resource type is not singleton, it&#39;s up to you as a module\ndeveloper to ensure that none of the resources it contains violate resource\nuniqueness constraints when the defined resource type is declared multiple\ntimes.\nBefore continuing, let&#39;s take a moment to review those constraints. To avoid\nduplicate resource errors during compilation, all resource must have a title\nand namevar parameter that are unique with respect to resources of the same\ntype.\nResource uniqueness constraints\nA resource&#39;s title is the unique identifier Puppet user internally to keep\ntrack of that resource. Resource relationships, for example, rely on resource\ntitles to specify dependency relationships between resources. Resource titles\nare also used to log and report on resource state changes across Puppet runs.\nA resource&#39;s namevar is the parameter that specifies the unique aspect on the\ntarget system that the resource manages. A resource doesn&#39;t actually have a\nparameter called namevar—rather the term namevar refers to the parameter that\nplays this role. For example, the namevar of a file resource is its path\nparameter. By requiring that a resource has a unique namevar, the Puppet parser\navoids creating conflicting definitions for the state of a single aspect of the\ntarget system. If Puppet allowed two file resource declarations with the same\npath parameter, for example, it would not be clear which of the two resource\ndeclarations should be enforced for the file at that path.\nThough a resource&#39;s title and namevar are distinct, the value you would assign\nto a resource&#39;s namevar is generally an excellent candidate for an expressive\nand unique title. For example, if the path of a file resource is\n/etc/hosts, using that path as the resource title makes it immediately clear\nwhat the the resource is managing. The common convention, then, is to use the\nvalue of a resource&#39;s namevar as its title. To support this convention, a\nresource&#39;s namevar default to the value of its title unless it is explicitly\nset to a different value. This is why, for instance, you generally see the\nfilepath or package name used the title of file and package resources, and\nthe path or name parameter left unset.\nMaintaining uniqueness in defined resource types\nNow that you understand resource uniqueness constraints, how do you guarantee\nthat the resources included in a defined resource type are unique?\nJust as you would give include a title in the declaration of any of Puppet&#39;s\nbuilt-in resource types, you include a title when declaring a defined resource\ntype. The title given to a defined resource type when it is declared is\navailable within the defined resource type&#39;s code block as the $title\nvariable. By incorporating this $title variable into the titles of each\nresource included in the defined resource type, you can ensure that as long as\nthe defined resource type itself is declared with a unique title, the resources\nit includes are also unique.\nManaging user accounts\nTo see how this all fits together, let&#39;s get started on a ssh_user defined\nresource type.\nLike a class, a defined resource type should be defined within a module. In\nmany cases, a defined resource type is included in a module to support the\nfunctionality provided by that module&#39;s class or classes. For example, the\npostgresql module you used in the previous quest provides defined resource\ntypes to help manage the groups of related resources that come together to\nmanage aspects of your database configuration such as databases, users, and\ngrants. In this case, however, we want to keep things simple, so we&#39;ll create a\nstandalone module to contain our defined resource type.\nTask 1:\n\nBefore you begin, make sure you&#39;re working in your module directory.\ncd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules\nCreate the user_accounts module&#39;s directory structure.\nmkdir -p user_accounts/manifests\nTask 2:\n\nNext, create a ssh_user.pp manifest to contain the user_accounts::ssh_user\ndefined resource type.\nvim user_accounts/manifests/ssh_user.pp\nWe want to manage the user account itself along with the user&#39;s public key for\nSSH, so we&#39;ll expose a few basic parameters for the user resource as well as a\npub_key parameter for the user&#39;s public key.\nThe parameter list for your defined type should look like this:\ndefine user_accounts::ssh_user (\n  $pub_key,\n  $group   = undef,\n  $shell   = undef,\n  $comment = undef,\n){\n  ...\n}\n\nNote that the $pub_key parameter has no default value, while the default\nvalues for the other parameters are set to &#39;undef&#39;. There is an important\ndifference here.\nA parameter with no supplied default value is required. Leaving out a default\nvalue for the $pub_key parameter means that declaring an instance of this\nssh_user defined resource type without supplying a value for the $pub_key\nparameter will result in a compilation error. Because this resource requires\na user&#39;s public key in order to correctly provide SSH access with public key\nauthentication, this is the desired behavior.\n  ssh_authorized_key { &quot;${title}@puppet.vm&quot;:\n    ensure =&gt; present,\n    user   =&gt; $title,\n    type   =&gt; &#39;ssh-rsa&#39;,\n    key    =&gt; $pub_key,\n  }\n\nThe group, shell, and comment parameters, on the other hand, are not\nrequired. The ssh_user defined resource type, includes an ordinary user\nresource to actual user account on the system.\n  user { $title:\n    ensure  =&gt; present,\n    groups  =&gt; $group,\n    shell   =&gt; $shell,\n    home    =&gt; &quot;/home/${title}&quot;,\n    comment =&gt; $comment,\n  }\n\nThis user resource already has its own defaults for handling group,\nshell, and comment. The desired behavior, then, is to use the values passed\nin by parameter when they&#39;re provided, but revert to the user type&#39;s own\ndefaults for any of these parameters that isn&#39;t supplied when the defined\nresource type is declared.\nThe special undef value lets you achieve both of these things. Under the hood\nundef is exactly what Puppet sees when it tries to evaluate a variable or\nparameter that has not been set. By setting it as the default for your optional\nparameters, you can literally pass the &quot;undefined&quot; state of a parameter through\nto the underlying user resource, which will then fall back to its default\nbehavior for that parameter.\nPutting these user and ssh_authorized_key resources together with file\nresources to manage the user&#39;s home directory and .ssh directory, your\nuser_accounts::ssh_user defined resource type will look like this:\ndefine user_accounts::ssh_user (\n  $pub_key,\n  $group   = undef,\n  $shell   = undef,\n  $comment = undef,\n){\n  ssh_authorized_key { &quot;${title}@puppet.vm&quot;:\n    ensure =&gt; present,\n    user   =&gt; $title,\n    type   =&gt; &#39;ssh-rsa&#39;,\n    key    =&gt; $pub_key,\n  }\n  file { &quot;/home/${title}/.ssh&quot;:\n    ensure =&gt; directory,\n    owner  =&gt; $title,\n    group  =&gt; $title,\n    mode   =&gt; &#39;0700&#39;,\n    before =&gt; Ssh_authorized_key[&quot;${title}@puppet.vm&quot;],\n  }\n  user { $title:\n    ensure  =&gt; present,\n    groups  =&gt; $group,\n    shell   =&gt; $shell,\n    home    =&gt; &quot;/home/${title}&quot;,\n    comment =&gt; $comment,\n  }\n  file { &quot;/home/${title}&quot;:\n    ensure =&gt; directory,\n    owner  =&gt; $title,\n    group  =&gt; $title,\n    mode   =&gt; &#39;0755&#39;,\n  }\n}\n\nString interpolation\nYou may have noticed another new element of syntax into this code. Some of the\ndouble-quoted strings (&quot;...&quot;) in this manifest include variables in the\n${var_name} format. This is Puppet&#39;s string\ninterpolation\nsyntax. String interpolation allows you to insert a variable into any\ndouble-quoted string.\nString interpolation is useful throughout Puppet, but it is particularly\nsalient in the context of defined resource types because it allows you to\nincorporate the $title variable of the defined resource type itself into the\ntitles of its constituent resources.  The title of the ssh_authorized_key\nresource, for example, looks like &quot;${title}@puppet.vm&quot;.\nWhy is this so important? Remember, all resources included in the body of a\ndefined resource type must still meet the same uniqueness constraints of any\nother Puppet resource. By passing the unique given to the defined resource type\nitself through to each constituent resource, whether directly, as in the case\nof the user resource, or indirectly through string interpolation, you can\nguarantee the uniqueness of all the resources included within the defined\nresource type.\nTask 3:\n\nNormally you would ask the users who needed accounts on this system to provide\ntheir own public keys. For the sake of demonstration, however, you&#39;ll generate\none key pair to use with all the users you&#39;re going to manage. This will allow\nyou to log in as those users and validate that the defined resource type has\nworked as expected.\nUse the ssh-keygen command to create a new keypair:\nssh-keygen -t rsa\nAccept the default location and supply the password puppet.\nWith this key created, you&#39;re ready to write the Puppet code to actually\ndeclare which users we want on a system.\nTask 4:\n\nRather than place this directly in your site.pp manifest, as you might have\nbefore we introduced the roles and profiles pattern, we&#39;ll create a\npasture_dev_users profile class, and use a Hiera lookup to programmatically\ncreate users as needed on each system in your infrastructure.\nIn this case, we&#39;ll include our user accounts on all nodes in the beauvine.vm\ndomain, so we&#39;ll be editing the domain/beauvine.vm.yaml Hiera data source at\n/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml.\nAssuming you&#39;re still working in your modules directory, go up one level to\n/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/ to make it easier to access\nthis data directory.\ncd ..\nBefore you open the data file to edit, save some effort by using the bash &gt;&gt;\nappend operator to append it to your id_rsa.pub public key to the end of the\ndata file.\ncat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub &gt;&gt; data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml\nNow open the file:\nvim data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml\nCreate a new line to define a Hiera value for\nprofile::base::dev_users::users:. Here, we&#39;ll take advantage of\nHiera&#39;s structured data features to define two instances of the new ssh_user\nand set the parameters for each. For now, just focus on entering this data\ncorrectly into your YAML data file. You&#39;ll see a little later how this\nstructured data is actually implemented by a Puppet manifest.\nThe final content of the file is given below, but managing the big pub_key\nblock may be a little awkward, especially if you&#39;re not used to Vim. (If you\nare comfortable with Vim, feel free to skip this paragraph)\nFirst, you&#39;ll need to trim the ssh-rsa and root@learning.puppetlabs.vm strings\nfrom the beginning and end of the key. First, position your cursor over the\nline with the key. Be sure you&#39;re in command mode by hitting the ESC key.\nFrom command mode, you can navigate easily to the beginning or end of the line\nwith the ^ and $ keys, respectively. Once your cursor is over the ssh-rsa\nor root@learning.puppetlabs.vm string, you can delete it from command mode\nwith the command daW. You&#39;ll use the same key from both users, so you&#39;ll also\nneed to copy it. You can copy a line with the command yy and paste it to the\nposition of your cursor with the p key.  You can also delete a line with the\ndd command.\nWhen your finished, your data file should look like the following example,\nthough your public key will be different from the one shown. Note that the\npub_key: must all be on a single line.\n---\nprofile::pasture::app::default_message: &quot;Welcome to Beauvine!&quot;\nprofile::base::dev_users::users:\n  - title: &#39;bessie&#39;\n    comment: &#39;Bessie Johnson&#39;\n    pub_key: &#39;AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCVWbkvtB4G/x9eEHXUkFfQgJuxBNJ3MCJ\n3BWbYHb+Ksmd2I92G9wSVFWRDvLzciOsWkbjfSWHrql+82lgplyxBHZZYlf0eK3ytkSL5hvQtOmLW\nMDcWNbHnt7qZFA0j6/h43SG0POmkG1iHSHnlwvbcpJoYZZpKz5+Iq7P9JmOv7zf8UsJtQccWHxAHc\nJ+xJ6xZJ2EBziWUCMPxLnD3zNQaW0r/B3pRMT+7F1gDHJ8HuNVklcQGCpVS+WrfpNMJ5+L25Aw/H2\nBg33o+0esH5FL8M8IR3Xkgp80NAQqmyVi7cx+c9n4RjEdMGk3XtutPNsSLcgm8/YZqv/yTRH6wAQl\n/&#39;\n  - title: &#39;gertie&#39;\n    comment: &#39;Gertie Philips&#39;\n    pub_key: &#39;AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCVWbkvtB4G/x9eEHXUkFfQgJuxBNJ3MCJ\n3BWbYHb+Ksmd2I92G9wSVFWRDvLzciOsWkbjfSWHrql+82lgplyxBHZZYlf0eK3ytkSL5hvQtOmLW\nMDcWNbHnt7qZFA0j6/h43SG0POmkG1iHSHnlwvbcpJoYZZpKz5+Iq7P9JmOv7zf8UsJtQccWHxAHc\nJ+xJ6xZJ2EBziWUCMPxLnD3zNQaW0r/B3pRMT+7F1gDHJ8HuNVklcQGCpVS+WrfpNMJ5+L25Aw/H2\nBg33o+0esH5FL8M8IR3Xkgp80NAQqmyVi7cx+c9n4RjEdMGk3XtutPNsSLcgm8/YZqv/yTRH6wAQl\n/&#39;\n\nYou can use a Ruby one-liner to validate that your YAML file can be parsed\ncorrectly.\nruby -e &quot;require &#39;yaml&#39;;require &#39;pp&#39;;pp YAML.load_file(&#39;./data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml&#39;)&quot;\nThe output should look like the following:\n{&quot;profile::pasture::app::default_message&quot;=&gt;&quot;Welcome to Beauvine!&quot;,\n &quot;profile::base::dev_users::users&quot;=&gt;\n  [{&quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;bessie&quot;,\n    &quot;comment&quot;=&gt;&quot;Bessie Johnson&quot;,\n    &quot;pub_key&quot;=&gt;\n     &quot;AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCVWbkvtB4G/x9eEHXUkFfQgJuxBNJ3MCJ3BWbYHb+\nKsmd2I92G9wSVFWRDvLzciOsWkbjfSWHrql+82lgplyxBHZZYlf0eK3ytkSL5hvQtOmLWMDcWNbHn\nt7qZFA0j6/h43SG0POmkG1iHSHnlwvbcpJoYZZpKz5+Iq7P9JmOv7zf8UsJtQccWHxAHcJ+xJ6xZJ\n2EBziWUCMPxLnD3zNQaW0r/B3pRMT+7F1gDHJ8HuNVklcQGCpVS+WrfpNMJ5+L25Aw/H2Bg33o+0e\nsH5FL8M8IR3Xkgp80NAQqmyVi7cx+c9n4RjEdMGk3XtutPNsSLcgm8/YZqv/yTRH6wAQl/&quot;},\n   {&quot;title&quot;=&gt;&quot;gertie&quot;,\n    &quot;comment&quot;=&gt;&quot;Gertie Philips&quot;,\n    &quot;pub_key&quot;=&gt;\n     &quot;AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCVWbkvtB4G/x9eEHXUkFfQgJuxBNJ3MCJ3BWbYHb+\nKsmd2I92G9wSVFWRDvLzciOsWkbjfSWHrql+82lgplyxBHZZYlf0eK3ytkSL5hvQtOmLWMDcWNbHn\nt7qZFA0j6/h43SG0POmkG1iHSHnlwvbcpJoYZZpKz5+Iq7P9JmOv7zf8UsJtQccWHxAHcJ+xJ6xZJ\n2EBziWUCMPxLnD3zNQaW0r/B3pRMT+7F1gDHJ8HuNVklcQGCpVS+WrfpNMJ5+L25Aw/H2Bg33o+0e\nsH5FL8M8IR3Xkgp80NAQqmyVi7cx+c9n4RjEdMGk3XtutPNsSLcgm8/YZqv/yTRH6wAQl/&quot;}]}\n\nWe&#39;ll also change the common.yaml data source to set a default for this key.\nIn this case, we&#39;ll set the value to an empty list. This way, when Hiera tries\nto look up this value on a node outside of the beauvine.vm domain, it will\nstill get a valid result.\nvim data/common.yaml\nYour common.yaml file should look like the following:\n---\nprofile::pasture::app::default_message: &quot;Baa&quot;\nprofile::pasture::app::sinatra_server: &quot;thin&quot;\nprofile::pasture::app::default_character: &quot;sheep&quot;\nprofile::pasture::app::db: &quot;none&quot;\nprofile::base::dev_users::users: []\n\nTask 5:\n\nNow that this data is available in Hiera, create a dev_users.pp manifest\nin profile/manifests/base/.\nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/profile/manifests/base/dev_users.pp\nYour user_accounts::ssh_user defined resource type gives you a way to create\na new user account with an SSH key from a set of parameter inputs, and your\nHiera data file defines the list of inputs for each user, but we still haven&#39;t\naddressed how to bring this data together with your code.\nHere, we&#39;ll use a Puppet language feature called an\niterator. An\niterator allows you to repeat a block of Puppet code multiple times, using\ndata from a hash or array to bind different values to the variables in\nthe block for each iteration. In this case, the iterator goes through a\nlist of users accounts defined in your Hiera data source and declares an\ninstance of the user_accounts::ssh_user defined resource type for each.\nclass profile::base::dev_users {\n  lookup(profile::base::dev_users::users).each |$user| {\n    user_accounts::ssh_user { $user[&#39;title&#39;]:\n        comment =&gt; $user[&#39;comment&#39;],\n        pub_key =&gt; $user[&#39;pub_key&#39;],\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nWhen using iteration, be very mindful of your code&#39;s readability and\nmaintainability. One of the Puppet language&#39;s benefits is that its declarative\nnature tends to make Puppet code itself readable description of desired state\nfor your system. Used unnecessarily, iteration can increase your Puppet code&#39;s\ncomplexity, making it more difficult to understand and maintain.\nIn this case, the roles and profiles pattern, Hiera, and the defined resource\ntype keep the rest of the code simple enough that the iterator&#39;s role is very\nclear. With a basic understanding of Puppet syntax, you can easily translate\nthe class into a sentence along the lines of &quot;Get the list of users from Hiera,\nand for each, create an SSH user account.&quot; If you find yourself writing\niterators that go much beyond this level of complexity, it&#39;s a good cue to stop\nand consider whether there&#39;s a clearer way to write your Puppet code.\nTask 6:\n\nWith this profile::base::dev_users class is set up, add it to the\nrole::pasture_app class.\nvim /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules/role/manifests/pasture_app.pp\nclass role::pasture_app {\n  include profile::pasture::app\n  include profile::base::dev_users\n  include profile::base::motd\n}\n\nTask 7:\n\nUse the puppet job tool to trigger a Puppet agent run.

Checking your Puppet code into SCM\nmakes it much easier for you and your team to collaborate, control change, and\nsafely test new features.\nThe concepts introduced in this quest mark an important transition in your\nprogress from learning Puppet basics to building a workflow suitable for\nmanaging production infrastructure.\nThough it is possible to use other SCM tools with Puppet, this quest focuses on\nGit. Learning to use Git effectively can be an undertaking in itself. This\nquest will provide all the git commands necessary to complete the included\ntasks, but it is not focused on teaching Git itself.\nThe git workflow included here is intended only as a working example; if Git or\nanother SCM tool is already implemented in your organization, there may be\nestablished practices that differ from the workflow outlined here.\nIf you would like to learn git or brush up on your skills before continuing,\nthe additional resources section at the end of this quest includes links to\nseveral options.\nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, type the following command:\nquest begin control_repository\nControl repository\nSo far, the work you&#39;ve done on the Learning VM has been on modules included\ndirectly in Puppet&#39;s modulepath. As a learning exercise, this has the advantage\nof simplicity and directness. To manage production infrastructure with Puppet,\nhowever, we strongly suggest adopting a workflow that allows for multiple\ncontributors to coordinate, review, and test their changes before modifying\nproduction code.\nA Puppet control repository is an SCM repository containing the code and\nconfiguration that define your Puppet infrastructure.\nPutting your Puppet codebase into source control allows each contributor to\nwork on a checked-out copy of the code without directly modifying anything in\nyour master&#39;s production modulepath. These code changes can then be reviewed\nand tested before being merged into the production codebase and deployed to the\nmaster&#39;s production environment.\nWe&#39;ll begin by creating a control-repo directory in your home directory. The\ncontents of this directory will ultimately be deployed to the\n/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/ directory on your master, so\nthe content of your control repository will be similar to what currently exists\nin that directory.\nTake a look at the contents of that directory:\nls /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/\nYou should see the following list of files and subdirectories that define your\nproduction Puppet environment:\ndata  environment.conf  hiera.yaml  manifests  modules\nThe role of most of these items should already be familiar from other quests.\nThe hiera.yaml file and data subdirectory contain the configuration\ninformation and data for Hiera. The manifests directory contains the\nsite.pp manifest that includes node definitions and classification, and the\nmodules directory contains the modules you&#39;ve installed from the Forge as\nwell as modules you&#39;ve created yourself, including your role and profile\nmodules. The\nenvironment.conf\nfile allows you to override certain Puppet master configuration settings when\nthe Puppet master is serving nodes assigned to this environment. So far, you\nhaven&#39;t had to make any changes to these settings, so you haven&#39;t encountered\nthis file until now.\nFor the most part, a control repository should include the same contents you\nsee currently in the production directory. However, there is one notable\ndifference: rather than a modules subdirectory a control repository generally\nhas distinct subdirectory called site. Your site directory should contains\nonly the site-specific modules that you (or your team) have written\nspecifically to manage your infrastructure, as these are the modules whose code\nshould be managed through your source control process.\nAny modules that come from an external source such as the Forge should not be\nincluded directly in a control repository. Those modules generally have their\nown dedicated public repositories on a site like GitHub\nand get published to the Forge whenever a new version is released. Attempting\nto mirror all the changes to these modules in your own repository would be a\nlarge duplication of effort. Instead, external modules are generally managed by\nsomething called a\nPuppetfile.\nWhen you use the Puppet Code Manager tool to deploy your control repository&#39;s\ncode to an environment on the master, it reads the list of external modules in\nyour Puppetfile and automatically installs them to the environment&#39;s modules\ndirectory. This lets easily keep your list of external module dependencies\nunder version control without duplicating their Puppet code and managing\nspecific code changes in your control repository.\nWe&#39;ll create a Puppetfile in the next quest and cover its use in more depth.\nFor now, we&#39;ll be focusing on the modules in your site directory whose code\nyou will be directly managing in your control repository. Just be aware that\nbecause the contents of the modules directory are typically defined by a\nPuppetfile, your site-specific modules are kept in the distinct site\ndirectory to avoid being removed or overwritten when external modules are\ninstalled.\nTask 1:\n\nBegin setting up your control repository by creating a /root/control-repo\ndirectory and the /root/control-repo/site subdirectory.\nmkdir -p /root/control-repo/site\nNext, navigate to your existing modules directory.\ncd /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/modules\nHere, we&#39;ll take a look at the existing modules to pick out the site-specific\nmodules to be included in the site directory of the control repository.\nls\nYou should see a list like the following:\napt concat cowsay epel motd  pasture  postgresql  profile  role  stdlib user_accounts\nTask 2:\n\nCopy the site-specific cowsay, pasture, motd, user_accounts, role,\nand profile Puppet modules into the your control repository&#39;s site\ndirectory.\ncp -r {cowsay,pasture,motd,user_accounts,role,profile} /root/control-repo/site/\nTask 3:\n\nNow that you&#39;re done bringing over your modules, we&#39;ll copy over the rest of\nthe production environment content to the control repository. Use cd to go up\na directory from the modules subdirectory to your production environment\ndirectory.\ncd ..\nHere, you need to make one more change to ensure that Puppet can actually find\nthe modules you just copied into the site directory. Remember, Puppet can\nonly find modules included in its modulepath. By default, this includes the\nmodules directory, but not the site directory. For Puppet to find these\nsite modules, this directory must be added to the modulepath. To do this,\nwe&#39;ll use the environment.conf configuration file to override the Puppet\nmaster&#39;s default modulepath setting.\nFirst, copy the existing environment.conf file to your control repository.\nThere aren&#39;t yet any settings specified in this file, but there are some useful\nexplanatory comments at the top of the file that we might as well preserve.\ncp environment.conf /root/control-repo/environment.conf\nNext, edit this configuration file.\nvim /root/control-repo/environment.conf\nInclude the following line at the end of the file to ensure that both site\nand modules are included in the modulepath setting for this environment.\nmodulepath = site:modules:$basemodulepath\nTask 4:\n\nNext, create your control repository&#39;s manifests directory.\nmkdir /root/control-repo/manifests\nCopy over your existing site.pp manifest.\ncp manifests/site.pp /root/control-repo/manifests/site.pp\nTask 5:\n\nThe last remaining items to copy are those related to Hiera.\nFirst, copy over your hiera.yaml configuration file.\ncp hiera.yaml /root/control-repo/hiera.yaml\nThen recursively copy the Hiera data directory and its contents.\ncp -r data /root/control-repo/data\nGit repository initialization\nWith this done, your control repository includes everything needed to manage\nyour Puppet infrastructure. You&#39;re ready to check your Puppet code into source\ncontrol. To do this, you&#39;ll be using the git command-line tool. This quest\nwill provide all the Git commands needed to complete this process and address\nsteps that are specifically relevant to Puppet, but will not go into great\ndepth about the inner workings of Git—it is a complex tool in its own right,\nand there are plenty of existing resources available online to help get you\nup to speed. (See the Additional Resources section at the end of this quest\nfor a few examples.)\nFirst, you will need to initialize the control-repo directory as a Git\nrepository. Next, you will set up a hosted remote repository to act as an\nupstream source for your code. Finally, you will configure Puppet to fetch code\nfrom the hosted control repository and deploy it to the Puppet master&#39;s\nproduction environment.\nThis architecture allows multiple contributors to work on the same codebase\nwhile ensuring that any changes they make can be tested and approved before\nbeing committed to the upstream repository and deployed to production.\n\nTask 6:\n\nFirst, navigate to the control-repo directory.\ncd /root/control-repo\nUse the git init command to initialize your control-repo directory as a Git\nrepository. This command will create a hidden .git subdirectory to store\nrepository data.\ngit init\nStage the files in your control repository for an initial commit with the git\nadd command. In this case, you can easily add everything by using the *\nwildcard.  Be aware, however, that in most cases it is best to use more\nspecific git add commands to ensure that you are always aware of which files\nyou&#39;re staging for your commit.\ngit add *\nUse the git status command to see the list of files that will be added in\nyour commit.\ngit status\nNow that these files are staged, commit the changes. When you commit changes,\nyou will be prompted for a commit message. This message should include a\nconcise title separate by one line from a complete description of the changes\nintroduced by the commit. Projects and teams should develop their own\nconventions around the specifics of a good commit message to ensure that there\nis a complete record of all code changes.\ngit commit\nWhen prompted, enter something like the following as your commit message. When\nyou save and exit Vim, Git will pick up the commit message you entered and\ncomplete the commit.\nInitial commit\n\nThis initial commit includes Hiera configuration, site\nmodules developed in previous Learning VM quests,\nclassification defined by the site.pp manifest, and\nan environment.conf configuration file.\nTask 7:\n\nWhen you ran the git status command, you may have noticed that the output\nbegan with the following line:\nOn branch master\nIn Git, a branch represents a chain of commits—all all the individual changes\nthat have been made to your code to get it to its current state. Generally a\nproject in Git will have a main branch that includes all the commits that have\nbeen reviewed and approved by the project owners. To keep track of work in\nprogress before it is approved and merged into the main branch, developers\ngenerally create their own feature branches to keep one or more commits related\nto their changes to the main code base.\nWhen you initialize a new repository, Git creates a default main branch called\nmaster. The convention for Puppet, however, is to call its main branch\nproduction. This way, the branch name matches up with the production code\nenvironment on your Puppet master.\nBefore continuing, then, rename the master branch to production.\ngit branch -m master production\nUpstream remote setup\nNow that the repository is initialized locally and your branch name is set\ncorrectly, you&#39;re ready to push your local repository to an upstream remote.\nThis upstream remote is simply another copy of the repository hosted by a\nservice that makes it available to all collaborators and provides a permissions\nsystem to manage access by these collaborators. By granting Puppet itself\npermissions to this hosted repository by way of a deploy key, you will Puppet&#39;s\nCode Manager tool the ability to fetch hosted Puppet code and deploy it to the\nmaster.\nIn this case, we&#39;ll be using a tool called Gitea to host this upstream remote.\nGitea is an open-source Git hosting service with features generally similar to\nGitHub. We chose to use Gitea here because we could\neasily host an instance on the Learning VM itself. Because stability and\nsecurity of your upstream remote can be critical concerns, however, most PE\nusers use a SaaS option such as GitHub or a similar supported SCM service that\ncan run on-premise. Once you understand the setup and workflow using Gitea,\nhowever, the principles should translate easily to any of these services.\nBefore pushing the content of your control repository to Gitea, you&#39;ll need to\nset up your user account and create your new upstream repository through the\nGitea web interface.\nTask 8:\n\nTo connect to the Gitea web UI, go to &lt;VM IP ADDRESS&gt;:3000 in your web\nbrowser.\nFirst, click the Register button near the top right of the interface.\n\nWhen prompted, enter the following credentials.\nUsername: learningEmail: learning@puppet.vmPassword puppet  \n(Note that the Gitea server is running locally on the Learning VM, so unlike an\naccount on a similar service like GitHub, this account exists only on the\nLearning VM&#39;s own local Gitea instance.)\nOnce you have created an account, log in with your new credentials.\nTask 9:\n\nCreate a new repository by clicking on the + icon to the right of the\nMy Repositories header.\n\nEnter control-repo in the Repository Name field. Leave the other fields\nempty or with their default values. Click the Create Repository button at\nthe bottom of the page.\nNow that this Gitea repository is set up, return to the Learning VM command\nline.\nTask 10:\n\nFrom within your /root/control-repo directory, run the following command to\nset the Gitea hosted repository as your local repository&#39;s upstream remote.\ngit remote add upstream http://localhost:3000/learning/control-repo.git\nTo validate that your remote was correctly added, run:\ngit remote -v\nYou should see the following output:\nupstream        http://localhost:3000/learning/control-repo.git (fetch)\nupstream        http://localhost:3000/learning/control-repo.git (push)\nTask 11:\n\nNext, push your local production branch to this upstream remote. Note that\nbecause this is the first time you&#39;re adding content to the upstream remote,\nyou&#39;re pushing it directly to the production branch. Normally you would\ncreate a new branch and submit a pull request to avoid making changes to your\nproduction infrastructure without review or testing. We&#39;ll go over that full\nworkflow a little later in this quest.\ngit push upstream production\nEnter the username learning and password puppet if prompted.\nReturn to the Gitea interface in your browser or refresh the page. You can now\naccess all the content of your control repository through the Gitea web\ninterface.\nTask 12:\n\nBecause you have changed your default branch to production locally, you\nneed to make a corresponding change to the upstream repository. Open the\nSettings page in the Gitea interface, and click on the Branches tab.\n\nIn the Default Branch section, select production from the dropdown menu\nand click the Update Settings button to save your change.\n\nCode Manager deploy key\nThe Code Manager tool lets you automate the deployment of Puppet code to your\nmaster from a control repository. To configure code manager, we&#39;ll need to set\nup authentication with an RSA keypair. This will allow Gitea to authenticate\nthe Puppet master when it requests code from the control repository to deploy.\nFirst, we&#39;ll create the key on the Learning VM and give the pe-puppet user\naccess to it. Next, we&#39;ll add the public half of this key to the upstream\nremote via the Gitea interface. Finally, we&#39;ll use the PE console to enable\nCode Manager and tell it where to find the private half of the keypair it will\nuse to authenticate itself with Gitea.\nTask 13:\n\nBegin by creating a new ssh subdirectory in /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver:\nmkdir /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh\nNext, use the ssh-keygen command to generate a new keypair.\nssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C &quot;learning@puppet.vm&quot;\nWhen prompted, save the key to the following file:\n/etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa\nWhen prompted for a passphrase, hit enter twice to create a key without a\npassphrase.\nSet the owner and group of this ssh subdirectory to pe-puppet:\nchown -R pe-puppet:pe-puppet /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh\nTask 14:\n\nNow that the keypair is set up, you&#39;ll need to add it to Gitea.\nFirst, click on the Settings tab near the top right of the window. From\nhere, go to the Deploy Keys section.\nTo add your deploy key, you have two options. Your first option is to simply\ncopy and paste the key. You can view the public key on the vim with the cat\ncommand.\ncat /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa.pub\nCopy only the actual key segment between ssh-rsa and learning@puppet.vm to\nyour clipboard. Click on the Add Deploy Key button in the Gitea interface,\nand paste the key into the Content field of the form. If you are copying\nfrom the Learning VM&#39;s web-based console, you will have to manually delete\nseveral line-breaks to ensure that you&#39;re inputting a clean copy of the public\nkey. Set the Title field to &quot;Code Manager&quot;, leave the Enable Write Access\ncheckbox unchecked, and click on the Add Deploy Key button to add the key.\nIf you get an error, check that what you inserted matches the key exactly,\nwithout linebreaks or extra spaces before or after the key.\nThe other option is to run the following command on the Learning VM to add the\nkey via Gitea&#39;s API.\n    curl -i \\\n    -H &quot;Content-Type: application/json&quot; \\\n    -X POST -d &quot;{\\&quot;Title\\&quot;: \\&quot;Code Manager\\&quot;,\\&quot;Key\\&quot;: \\&quot;$(cut -d&#39; &#39; -f 2 /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa.pub)\\&quot;}&quot; \\\n    http://learning:puppet@localhost:3000/api/v1/repos/learning/control-repo/keys\nOnce you&#39;ve run this command, refresh your browser window to confirm that the\nkey has been added successfully.\nCode Manager configuration\nBefore you can deploy code from your control repository, you need to enable and\nconfigure Code Manager. Code Manager, like many of PE&#39;s internal configuration\noptions, is managed by Puppet itself. Most configuration options of your Puppet\nmaster, including those related to Code Manager, are managed by the\npuppet_enterprise::profile::master class. Like any Puppet class, this master\nprofile can be configured through its parameters.\nSo far, you&#39;ve been using the site.pp manifest to assign classes to nodes and\nset their parameters. The PE console&#39;s interface provides an alternative\ninterface for node classification. The PE console&#39;s node classifier includes a\nbuilt-in set of node groups and classifications that define configuration\nrelated to Puppet itself.\nTask 15:\n\nFirst, open the PE console interface in your browser by navigating to\nhttps://&lt;VM IP ADDRESS&gt;. Log in with the credentials:\nuser: adminpassword: puppetlabs\nClick on the Classification tab in the PE console navigation menu. From\nthere, expand the All nodes and PE Infrastructure groups and select\nthe PE Master node group.\n\nIn the PE Master node group interface, select the Configuration tab.\nLocate the puppet_enterprise::profile::master class in the class list.\nSelect the code_manager_auto_configure parameter from the drop-down menu and\nset the value to true. Click the Add parameter button to the left.\nFollowing the same method, set the r10k_remote parameter to\nhttp://localhost:3000/learning/control-repo.git, the r10k_private_key\nparameter to /etc/puppetlabs/puppetserver/ssh/id-control_repo.rsa, and\nfile_sync_enabled to true.\nClick the Commit N changes button to save your changes to the console.\n\nTask 16:\n\nTrigger a puppet agent run to enforce these configuration changes on the\nmaster.\npuppet agent -t\nDeploying Puppet code\nWith Code Manager configured and your deploy key set up, the Puppet master has\nread access to the code in your repository. Before this code in your control\nrepository is actually used, however, it will need to be deployed to a code\nenvironment on the master.\nThere are some options for further automation of this process. For example, you\ncan configure a\nwebhook\nto automatically trigger a deployment whenever new code is merged to the\nupstream repository. In this case, we&#39;ll keep things simple and hands-on by\nusing the puppet code deploy command to manually trigger a code deployment.\nLike the puppet job run command you&#39;ve been using to trigger Puppet runs,\nthis command can be run from any workstation with the correct credentials and\nnetwork access to the Puppet master.\nTask 17:\n\nFrom the PE console interface, click on Access Control in the left\nnavigation bar and select the User Roles link in the left navigation bar.\nClick on the Code Deployers role.  From the Member Users tab, select\nyour Learning user from the dropdown menu and click Add user to add this\nuser to the role.\nClick the Commit 1 change button to save your changes to the console.\nTask 18:\n\nNow use the puppet access command to generate a token.\npuppet access login --lifetime 1d\nWhen prompted, use the following credentials:\nUsername: learningPassword: puppet  \nUse the puppet code deploy command to deploy the production branch of your\ncontrol repository to your production code environment. Add the --wait flag\nto tell the command to wait until the deploy is complete before exiting.\npuppet code deploy production --wait\nWhen the deploy process completes, your production code directory at\n/etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production will by synchronized with your\ncontrol repository.\nTask 19:\n\nUse the puppet job tool to trigger a Puppet agent run on the\npasture-app.beauvine.vm node. When this quest began, a new instance of this\nnode was created without any previous configuration applied, so this run will\ntest that the newly deployed code from your repository can create and apply a\ncorrect catalog for this node. This Puppet run will apply the configuration\ncurrently defined in your role::pasture_app, as specified by the site.pp\nmanifest.\npuppet job run --nodes pasture-app.beauvine.vm\nOnce the job is complete, validate that the service is running as expected on\nthe node:\ncurl &#39;pasture-app.beauvine.vm/api/v1/cowsay&#39;\nControl repository development workflow\nNow that Puppet is running with code deployed from your control repository,\nlet&#39;s walk through the process of introducing changes to your a local copy of\nthe repository, creating a PR to merge those changes to your upstream\nrepository, and finally deploying those changes to production.\nTask 20:\n\nFirst, be sure you&#39;re working in this control-repo directory:\ncd ~/control-repo\nBefore beginning work, take a moment to check the status of the git repository.\ngit status\nYou should see the following message:\n# On branch production\nnothing to commit, working directory clean\nYou can see that you&#39;re currently on the production branch, and that there are\nno uncommitted changes in the working directory.\nNext, it&#39;s good practice to check for updates to the upstream remote before\nbeginning new work. Collaborators may have introduced to the upstream\nrepository. To avoid merge conflicts, pull any changes into your local\nrepository before starting new work.\ngit pull upstream production\nGit shows you that your local repository is up to date with the upstream\nversion, so no changes have been made.\nFrom http://localhost:3000/&lt;yourname&gt;/control-repo\n* branch            production -&gt; FETCH_HEAD\nAlready up-to-date.\nNow that you&#39;ve verified the status of your local repository, you&#39;re ready to\nbegin work on a new branch. The focus of this quest is the control repository\nand code deployer workflow, so we&#39;ll make a small and easily tested change to\nthe default_message parameter in your beauvine.vm domain&#39;s Hiera data.\nTo begin work on this change, create a new branch. The branch name should be\nbrief, but still give good idea of what changes the branch will introduce.\nLet&#39;s call it beauvine_default_message. Use the git checkout command to\nswitch to this branch. The -b flag tells Git to create a new branch with this\nname if it doesn&#39;t already exist.\ngit checkout -b beauvine_default_message\nWith this new branch is set up, open the data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml file\nin Vim.\nvim data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml\nHere, edit the value of the default_message variable to read &#39;Hello control\nrepository!&#39;.\nprofile::pasture::app::default_message: &quot;Hello control repository!&quot;\n\nTask 21:\n\nOnce you&#39;ve made your change, check the status of the repository.\ngit status\nThe output will show your current branch and give you a list of the changes\nthat have not yet been staged for commit:\n# On branch beauvine_default_message\n# Changes not staged for commit:\n#   (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to update what will be committed)\n#   (use &quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)\n#\n#       modified:   data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml\n#\nno changes added to commit (use &quot;git add&quot; and/or &quot;git commit -a&quot;)\nTo stage your change, use the git add command. This will tell Git to include\nyour change to this file in your next commit. If you had changed multiple\nfiles, you would add each so that they could be included in the same commit.\ngit add data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml\nOnce your change is staged, check the status again to see the file listed as\na change to be committed.\n# On branch beauvine_default_message\n# Changes to be committed:\n#   (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)\n#\n#       modified:   data/domain/beauvine.vm.yaml\n#\nNow that your change is staged, you&#39;re ready to commit it.\ngit commit\nWhen prompted, enter the following commit message to describe your change.\nYour commit message doesn&#39;t need to match exactly what is given below, but it&#39;s\nimportant that you take the time to write out a complete message. Including a\nuseful commit message each time you make a change will ensure that you have a\ndetailed log of all changes to your code to use as a reference when\ntroubleshooting an issue or planning new changes. \nChange beauvine default_message in Hiera\n\nChange the default_message value for the beauvine domain to &quot;Hello\ncontrol repository!&quot; to demonstrate the code management workflow with a\ncontrol repository.\n# Please enter the commit message for your changes.

A pull request is a way of suggesting that commits in\none branch of a project are merged into another. A pull request creates an\nopportunity for collaborators on a project to do a final review of code changes\nbefore incorporating them into the project&#39;s main branch.\nOpen the Gitea interface (&lt;VM&#39;s IP ADDRESS&gt;:3000) in a browser window.\nFrom the Branch: dropdown menu, select your new beauvine_default_message\nbranch. Click the icon next to the dropdown menu to compare your branches and\nbegin a pull request. Fill out the pull request form with the title and\ndescription of your pull request. Because this pull request consists of a\nsingle commit, you may want to use the same title and commit message as that\ncommit.\nClick the Create Pull Request button to create the pull request.\nAt this point, you would normally wait for one or more collaborators to review,\ntest, and merge your pull request. In this case, you&#39;ll have to do the\nreviewing and merging yourself.\nClick on the Files changed tab, and examine the difference in code shown.\nWe haven&#39;t introduced methods for doing more complete testing of Puppet code,\nso you&#39;ll have to satisfy yourself with a quick review of the code change.\nWhen you&#39;re satisfied that your change is good, return to the Conversation\ntab and click the Merge Pull Request button.\nTask 24:\n\nNow that your change has been merged into your upstream repository&#39;s production\nbranch, return the the Learning VM command-line. Use puppet code deploy\ncommand to deploy your new code to the production environment.\npuppet code deploy production --wait\nTask 25:\n\nWhen the code deploy completes, trigger another Puppet run on your node to\napply the changes.\npuppet job run --nodes pasture-app.beauvine.vm\nValidate that the service now returns the new default message.\ncurl &#39;pasture-app.beauvine.vm/api/v1/cowsay&#39;\nReview\nIn this quest, you learned about the importance of a source control system for\ntracking and approving changes to your infrastructure by managing the\nunderlying Puppet code. You then walked through the set up of a control\nrepository and the workflow involved in developing and deploying code changes.\nYou began by using the git command-line tool to create and initialize a\ncontrol repository and moving your existing code into that repository.\nOnce your repository was set up locally, you used the Gitea service to create a\nremote upstream repository. This upstream repository serves as the central\nsource for all the code you will be deploying to your Puppet master.\nWith that repository set up, you used the PE console to configure Puppet&#39;s\nCode Manager tool to connect to your control repository hosted on Gitea.\nAfter deploying the existing code to test the system, you triggered a Puppet\nagent run on the pasture-app.beauvine.vm node to validate that your\nmaster&#39;s Puppet code would still function as expected.\nFinally, you went through the workflow of making a change in your local\nrepository, using a pull request to merge it into your upstream production\nbranch, and deploying and testing the new code.\nAdditional Resources\n\nRead up on using a control repository, the Code Manager tool, and other\nrelevant topics in the managing and deploying Puppet code section of the Puppet docs.\nPuppet maintains a template control repository\nyou can clone directly to get started on your own or use as reference.\nYou can find some good discussion of how a control repository can fit with\nthe roles and profiles patterns here\n\n"},"quests/puppetfile.html":{"url":"quests/puppetfile.html","title":"Puppetfile","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nPuppetfile\nQuest objectives\n\nCreate a Puppetfile to manage external module dependencies\nUse the puppet module tool to calculate dependencies and help determine\nwhich modules you need to include in your Puppetfile.\n\nGetting started\nIn this quest, you will add external module dependencies to your control\nrepository using a Puppetfile. \nWhen you&#39;re ready to get started, type the following command:\nquest begin puppetfile\nPuppetfile\nIn the Control Repository quest, you moved your Puppet modules into the\ncontrol-repo git repository. So far, however, this repository only includes\nthe Puppet code you wrote yourself as you worked through the previous quests\nin this guide. It doesn&#39;t contain any of the Forge modules you installed with\nthe Puppet module tool.\nThere&#39;s a good reason to leave these external modules out of your control\nrepository. Adding them directly would result in a large amount of duplicated\ncode. You would then need to manually manage versioning and updates for each of\nthese modules. Your site-specific code, which should be the focus of your\ncontrol repository, would be quickly overwhelmed by the bulk of this externally\nsourced code.\nA Puppetfile provides a more efficient solution for managing external module\ndependencies. It lets you use a single file to specify the desired version and\nsource for each external module. Puppet&#39;s Code Manager installs the modules\nspecified by your Puppetfile into your environment&#39;s modules directory during\nthe code deployment process.\nThis way, you can add, remove, and update external modules by changing one or\ntwo lines of code in your Puppetfile.\nTask 1:\n\nBecause the database-backed version of the Pasture application depends on the\npuppetlabs-postgresql module, you will need to include that module in your\nPuppetfile before Puppet can manage the application.\nFirst, ensure that you&#39;re working in the ~/control-repo directory.\ncd ~/control-repo\nBefore starting work, check the current status of the repository.\ngit status\nIf you&#39;re still on the feature branch from the previous quest, return to the\nproduction branch.\ngit checkout production\nRemember, the upstream version of your production branch incorporated the\nchanges you introduced with your feature branch. Fetch and merge those changes\ninto your local production branch with the git pull command.\ngit pull upstream production\nNow that your local production branch matches the upstream remote&#39;s production\nbranch, you&#39;re ready to create a new feature branch for your new work.\ngit checkout -b puppetfile\nTask 2:\n\nOpen a new file called Puppetfile in your editor.\nvim Puppetfile\nAdd the following line to include version 5.12.1 of the puppetlabs-postgresql\nmodule:\nmod &quot;puppetlabs/postgresql&quot;, &#39;5.12.1&#39;\n\nUnfortunately you&#39;re not quite done yet. Unlike the puppet module tool, Code\nManager does not automatically manage dependency trees for modules. If you have\na large number of modules for which you need to resolve dependencies, there are\na few third-party tools such as\npuppet-generate-puppetfile\nand librarian-puppet that can\nhelp with this.\nTask 3:\n\nIn this case, however, you&#39;re only dealing with one external module, so you can\nresort to a common work-around. Install the desired version of the\npuppetlabs/postgresql module into a temporary directory using the puppet\nmodule tool and use the tool&#39;s output to determine the needed dependencies.\nmkdir temp  \npuppet module install puppetlabs/postgresql --version 5.12.1 --modulepath=temp\nThe tool will return the following:\nNotice: Preparing to install into /root/control-repo/tmp ...\nNotice: Downloading from https://forge.puppet.com ...\nNotice: Installing -- do not interrupt ...\n/root/control-repo/tmp\n└─┬ puppetlabs-postgresql (v5.12.1)\n  ├─┬ puppetlabs-apt (v6.3.0)\n  │ └── puppetlabs-translate (v1.1.0)\n  ├── puppetlabs-concat (v5.3.0)\n  └── puppetlabs-stdlib (v5.2.0)\nClean up after yourself by removing the temporary directory.\nrm -rf temp\nReturn to your Puppetfile and add entries for the puppetlabs-apt,\npuppetlabs-translate, puppetlabs-concat, and puppetlabs-stdlib\nmodules using the listed versions.\nYour finished Puppetfile should look like this:\nmod &quot;puppetlabs/postgresql&quot;, &#39;5.12.1&#39;\nmod &quot;puppetlabs/apt&quot;, &#39;6.3.0&#39;\nmod &quot;puppetlabs/translate&quot;, &#39;1.1.0&#39;\nmod &quot;puppetlabs/concat&quot;, &#39;5.3.0&#39;\nmod &quot;puppetlabs/stdlib&quot;, &#39;5.2.0&#39;\n\nTask 4:\n\nStage your new Puppetfile to be committed:\ngit add Puppetfile\nAnd commit the change:\ngit commit\nEnter a commit message like the following:\nAdd Puppetfile with puppetlabs-postgresql module\n\nThe Pasture module depends on the `puppetlabs-postgresql` module for\nthe database-backed version of the application.

It may be helpful to use the docker ps command\nto list running container nodes. If you restart the VM, the docker service will\nbe reset and the generated nodes will be removed. If this happens, you must use\nthe quest tool to restart the quest. You will have to redo any tasks that\ninvolve changes on a generated node, such as triggering a Puppet run. Changes\nto Puppet code or configuration on the master will be preserved.\nIf you are prompted for a password to connect with one of the alternate user\naccounts in the Defined Resource Types quest, it is an indication that there\nis a problem with your Puppet code, Hiera data, or ssh-keypair. If configured\ncorrectly, you should be able connect without a password. You can check manually\nby logging in to the system as the learning user and using sudo to check\n/home/gertie/.ssh/authorized_keys. There should be an entry there matching the\nkey you generated and included in your Hiera file.\nRunning the puppet agent returns &quot;Server Error: Could not parse for environment production&quot;\nThe Puppet agent returns this error when it is unable to parse your Puppet code. The error\nmessage will indicate the file where the syntax error occurred. Use the puppet parser validate\ncommand to check the syntax of the indicated file. Note that problems with unpaired quotation marks,\nparentheses, and curly braces will often result in a syntax error shown for the end of the file\nwhere the parser&#39;s scan for the matching character failed. If the output of this syntax validation\nis not clear, compare your code against the example in the Quest Guide and against the solution\nfiles used we use for automated testing: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-quest-guide/tree/master/tests/solution_files.\nRunning the puppet agent returns &quot;connect(2) for learning.puppetlabs.vm port 8140&quot;\nThis generally indicates that the pe-puppetserver service is down. See\nthe section above for instructions on checking and restarting PE services.\nRunning the Puppet agent returns &quot;Failed to find facts from PuppetDB at learning.puppetlabs.vm:8140&quot;\nThis generally indicates that the pe-puppetdb service is down. Again,\nrefer to the section above for instructions on checking and restarting PE services.\nThe puppet job tool returns an error indicating that the node is not connected to the PCP broker\nWhen triggering a Puppet run via the puppet job tool, you may see an error\nsimilar to Error running puppet on pasture.puppet.vm: pasture.puppet.vm is not\nconnected to the PCP broker. A node connects to the PCP broker on its initial\nPuppet run. The agent nodes created by the quest tool will automatically run\nPuppet as they are created, which should generally connect the node to the PCP\nbroker. If this initial Puppet run fails, however, the node will not be\nconnected to the PCP broker, resulting in the error shown. To troubleshoot this\nissue, connect to the agent node directly and manually trigger a Puppet agent\nrun. This will either generate an error message to indicate the cause of the\nagent run&#39;s failure or run successfully and connect the node to the PCP broker.\nI cannot import or start the OVA\nEnsure that you have an up-to-date version of your virtualization software\ninstalled.  Note that the &quot;check for updates&quot; feature of VirtualBox may not\nalways work as expected, so check the website for the most recent version.\nEnsure that virtualization extensions enabled in the BIOS. The steps to do this\nwill be specific to your system, will generally available online.\nIf you are using Mac OS X and see Unable to retrieve kernel symbols,\nFailed to initialize monitor device, or Internal error, please refer to\nthis VMWare knowledge base page.\nVirtualBox is not compatible with Hyper-V. You will need to disable Hyper-V on\nyour system to successfully run the VM with VirtualBox.\nThe Learning VM has no IP address or the IP address will not respond.\nIf your network connection has changed since you loaded the VM, it&#39;s possible\nthat your IP address is different from that displayed on the Learning VM splash\nscreen. Log in to the VM via the virtualization directly (rather than SSH) and\nuse the ifconfig | less command to show the IP address associated with each\nnetwork interface. There will be several interfaces listed, including those\nused for internal docker networking. The correct interface will usually start\nwith eth or enp. If you continue to get no IP address or an\ninvalid IP address, restarting the VM is generally the quickest way to ensure\nthat the network services are correctly reset. (Unfortunately restarting the\nnetwork service directly isn&#39;t always reliable.)\nThere has been a history of issues with VirtualBox Host Only adapter settings\naffecting some Windows systems. If the settings you apply in the network\nadapter configuration interface seem to change or be re-set, please refer to\nthis VirtualBox ticket\nfor background information and a possible work-around.\nIt is also possible that the bridged adapter interface configured in the VM\nnetwork settings menu of your virtualization software is incorrect. This can\nhappen if you change from a wired to wireless network after setting the\ninterface for the first time. In the Network setting dialog, check that the\nname of the adapter matches that of the connection you are currently using. \nIf you are using a bridged network adapter, some network configurations may\nstill prevent you from accessing the Learning VM. If this is the case, we\nrecommend that you speak to your site network administrator to see if there are\nany firewall rules, proxies, or DHCP server setting that might be preventing\nyou from accessing the VM. If you are unable to resolve the issue, we recommend\nfollowing the directions in the setup guide to configure a host-only network\nadapter for the VM.\nI can&#39;t scroll up in my terminal\nThe Learning VM uses a tool called tmux to allow us to display the quest\nstatus. You can scroll in tmux by first hitting control-b, then [ (left\nbracket). You will then be able to use the arrow keys to scroll. Press q to\nexit scrolling.\nIs there a PDF version of the Quest Guide?\nWe decided to discontinue the PDF version of the Quest Guide, as a profusion\nof PDFs of different versions was making it difficult for users of the\nguide and VM to match the correct documentation to the correct version. If\nyou would like to look at the Quest Guide content without running the Learning\nVM, you can refer to the project&#39;s GitHub page:\nhttps://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-quest-guide/blob/master/en_us/summary.md. Note,\nhowever, that this may include unreleased changes and may not match with task\nvalidation and content on your copy of the Learning VM.\nStill need help?\nIf your puppet runs still fail after trying the steps above, check the Puppet\nEnterprise Known\nIssues\npage or feel free to contact us at learningvm@puppet.com. Please include\ndetails of your host OS, virtualization software and version, and any details\nof the site network configuration where you&#39;re running the VM (for example,\nwhether there is a proxy or restrictive firewall rules). If there are logs\nrelevant to the issue, you can use scp from your host machine to copy them to\na local directory:\nscp root@&lt;IPADDRESS&gt;:/var/log/messages messages\nOn a Windows system with PuTTY PSCP\ninstalled,\nyou can use pscp from a command prompt:\npscp root@&lt;IPADDRESS&gt;:/var/log/messages messages\n"},"releasenotes.html":{"url":"releasenotes.html","title":"Release Notes","body":"Quest Guide v2.5.1\nRelease Notes\n2.5.1\n\nExplain puppet-bolt package installation with host-only adapter\n\n2.5.0\n\nUpdated to PE 2019.0.2\nAdded new quest content describing Bolt and the Puppet product portfolio\nIncorporated user-reported bug fixes\n\nv2.4.0\n\nUpdated content for compatibility with PE 2019.0.1\nUpdated content for compatibility with currently-supported Puppet modules\nVarious typo, grammar and other verbiage fixes\nFixed control repository private key name\nAdded more specific instructions based on user feedback\n\nv2.3.0\n\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2017.3.5-learning-6.5.ova VM build\nAdded Hiera, Control Repository, and Puppetfile quests localized for English and Japanese.\nRemoved some unused packages to reduce VM archive size.\nMinor typo and punctuation fixes.\n\nv2.2.1\n\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2017.3.2-learning-6.4 VM build\nModified the quest setup script to ensure that the Docker SSL directory\ntree exists before attempting to copy keys from the Puppet SSL direcory.\nNew VM release fixes regression in the build process that added ~0.5GB to\nthe archive size.\n\nv2.2.0\n\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2017.3.2-learning-6.2 VM build\nRemoved Application Orchestration content pending implementation of Tasks\nquest to replace it.\nMade several improvements to the quest setup process.\nSeveral typo fixes and content clarifications.\nModified the pasture class to use the string &#39;none&#39; to specify no database\nconnection rather than undef.\n\nv2.1.0\n\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2017.2.2-learning-6.1 VM build.\nAdded internationalization framework and Japanese translated content.\nReplaced Stickler gem server with filesystem gem cache.\n\nv2.0.1\n\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2017.2.2-learning-6.0 VM build\nAdded missing task labels to the Defined Resource Types quest.\nVarious typo and spelling fixes.\nSeveral task validation test improvements.\nAdded some clarifications to the setup guide.\n\nv2.0.0\n\nComplete re-write of quest content and task spec tests.\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2017.2.1-learning-5.15 VM build\nUpdated the quest tool to improve quest setup process.\nMerged pltraining-learning module into pltraining-bootstrap.\nUpdated pltraining-bootstrap module to include a local gem server and Forge server.\nUpdated pltraining-bootstrap module to cache all needed content to fully support offline use.\nUpdated pltraining-dockeragent to support quest containerized agent use cases, including support for local gem server, local yum repo, ssh login, Puppet certificates, and PostgreSQL dependencies.\n\nv1.2.6\n\nAdd instructions to create cowsayings directory structure in the manifests\nand classes quest instead of relying on it being pre-created in the build.\n\nv1.2.5\n\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2016.2.1-learning-5.6 VM build.\nUpdated pltraining-bootstrap module turn off default line-numbering in vim.\nUpdated pltraining-learning module to create module structure directories for cowsay module.\n\nv1.2.4\n\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2016.2.1-learning-5.5 VM build.\nUpdated CSS styling.\nMinor changes to tests to be compatible with RESTful quest tool version. \nMinor content fixes.\n\nv1.2.3\n\nContent tested for compatibility with puppet-2016.2.0-learning-5.4 VM build.\nAdded privacy a link to Puppet&#39;s privacy policy.\nFixed a CSS alignment issue with the task icons.\nAdjusted CSS for headers and sidebar.\nFixed an issue with a missing / in the instruction code for the Variable and Parameters quest.\nAdded a version header note with a link to this release notes page.\nSpecified gitbook 3.1.1 in book.json.\n\nv1.2.2\n\nCleaned up formatting for task specs, generalized some tests to better match possible variations in Puppet code.\nUpdated screenshots to match PE 2016.2 console style changes.\nUpdated file resource declarations to better match best practices.\n\nv1.2.1\n\nAdded instructions for updating the timezone.\nAddressed clarity of instructions in Power of Puppet and NTP quests.\nBuild process has been modified to improve VirtualBox compatibility.\nIncrease suggested CPU allocation to 2.\nAdded test tests to test the quest tests.\nUpdate troubleshooting guide.\n\nv1.2.0\n\nAdded branded CSS styling.\nFixed incorrect offline module installation instructions.\nAdded instructions for installing cached gems when working offline.\nAdded GA gitbook plugin.\nAdjustments to splash screen.
