# Hello Bolt

## Quest objectives

- Install Bolt
- Verify the Bolt installation
- Run simple commands using Bolt

## Get started

In this quest, you will install Bolt and run some introductory commands.
As described in the previous quest, Bolt is a task runner that enables you
to invoke commands on one or more target nodes. It is well-suited to
performing actions in an ad hoc manner instead of managing a node on a
long-term basis.

Ready to get started? Run the following command on your Learning VM to begin
this quest:

    quest begin hello_bolt

## Install Bolt

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 1:</p></div>

Pre-built Bolt packages are available for various Red Hat Enterprise Linux,
SUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora distributions, as well as Windows and macOS.
The Learning VM is based on a CentOS (Red Hat Enterprise Linux equivalent)
7 image, so run the following command to configure the Puppet YUM repository:

    rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet6/puppet6-release-el-7.noarch.rpm

**NOTE:** If your Learning VM is configured with a host-only network, the
previous command will fail, but the `puppet-bolt` package has been cached for
convenience.

Now run this command to install Bolt:

    yum install puppet-bolt

## Verify the Bolt installation

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 2:</p></div>

Now that you have installed Bolt successfully, let's run some commands
to verify that it works correctly.

    bolt --help

    bolt --version

<div class = "lvm-task-number"><p>Task 3:</p></div>

Bolt provides a command-line interface for running commands, scripts, tasks
and plans on the local machine or remote nodes. Now let's practice running some
simple commands:

    bolt command run 'free -th' --nodes localhost

This command shows a human-readable report of the total memory allocated to
the local machine, how much is used and how much is free. The output should
look something like this:

```
Started on localhost...
Finished on localhost:
  STDOUT:
                  total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:           3.7G        2.3G        143M        183M        1.2G        878M
    Swap:          1.0G         10M        1.0G
    Total:         4.7G        2.3G        1.1G
Successful on 1 node: localhost
Ran on 1 node in 0.01 seconds
```

This demonstrates trivial usage of Bolt, but since the command is running on
the local machine, you could just as easily run `free -th` to get the same
output.

Bolt is better suited to running commands on one or more remote nodes so the
output can be collected and potentially acted upon by another tool. And instead
of using a tool like ssh in a `for` loop, you provide a list of nodes to Bolt,
and it will connect to each one and run the desired command. Now let's
try some examples using a Docker-hosted machine as target node:

    bolt command run hostname --nodes docker://bolt.puppet.vm

    bolt command run 'cat /etc/hosts' --nodes docker://bolt.puppet.vm

The output from these commands will look similar to the following:

```
Started on bolt.puppet.vm...
Finished on bolt.puppet.vm:
  STDOUT:
    bolt.puppet.vm
Successful on 1 node: docker://bolt.puppet.vm
Ran on 1 node in 0.05 seconds
```

```
Started on bolt.puppet.vm...
Finished on bolt.puppet.vm:
  STDOUT:
    127.0.0.1   localhost
    ::1 localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
    fe00::0     ip6-localnet
    ff00::0     ip6-mcastprefix
    ff02::1     ip6-allnodes
    ff02::2     ip6-allrouters
    172.18.0.1  learning.puppetlabs.vm puppet
    172.18.0.2  bolt.puppet.vm bolt
Successful on 1 node: docker://bolt.puppet.vm
Ran on 1 node in 0.05 seconds
```

Perhaps you want to generate machine-parseable output. That is also possible
by using the `--format` option to the `bolt` command like so:

    bolt --format json command run 'cat /etc/hosts' --nodes docker://bolt.puppet.vm

And the output will look similar to the following:

```
{ "items": [
{"node":"docker://bolt.puppet.vm","status":"success","result":{"stdout":"127.0.0.1\tlocalhost\n::1\tlocalhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback\nfe00::0\tip6-localnet\nff00::0\tip6-mcastprefix\nff02::1\tip6-allnodes\nff02::2\tip6-allrouters\n172.18.0.1\tlearning.puppetlabs.vm puppet\n172.18.0.2\tbolt.puppet.vm bolt\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}}
],
"node_count": 1, "elapsed_time": 0 }
```

The output can then be piped into a JSON query tool, such as `jq`, for
further processing. There are a number of other useful bolt command-line
options, and you can see them by running `bolt --help`.

## Review

In this quest, you installed Bolt, verified the installation
and practiced running some simple commands to get a feel for usage. Bolt is
a flexible task runner that can target multiple nodes at once, connect to
different types of nodes with a variety of protocols, including SSH, WinRM
and Docker, as shown in this quest.
